Abstract

We study a generalization of classical active learning to real-world settings with
concrete prediction targets where sampling is restricted to an accessible region
of the domain, while prediction targets may lie outside this region. We analyze
a family of decision rules that sample adaptively to minimize uncertainty about
prediction targets. We are the first to show, under general regularity assumptions,
that such decision rules converge uniformly to the smallest possible uncertainty
obtainable from the accessible data. We demonstrate their strong sample efficiency
in two key applications: active fine-tuning of large neural networks and safe
Bayesian optimization, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Introduction

Machine learning, at its core, is about designing systems that can extract knowledge or patterns from
data. One part of this challenge is determining not just how to learn given observed data but deciding
what data to obtain next, given the information already available. More formally, given an unknown
and sufficiently regular function f over a domain X: How can we learn f sample-efficiently from
(noisy) observations? This problem is widely studied in active learning and experimental design
(Chaloner & Verdinelli, 1995; Settles, 2009).

Active learning methods commonly aim to learn f globally, i.e., across the entire domain X. However,
in many real-world problems, (i) the domain is so large that learning f globally is hopeless or (ii)
agents have limited information and cannot access the entire domain (e.g., due to restricted access
or to act safely). Thus, global learning is often not desirable or even possible. Instead, intelligent
systems are typically required to act in a more directed manner and extrapolate beyond their limited
information. This work formalizes the above two aspects of active learning, which have remained
largely unaddressed by prior work. We provide a comprehensive overview of related work in Section 6.

“Directed” transductive active learning
We consider the generalized problem of transductive
active learning, where given two arbitrary subsets of the domain X; a target space A ⊆X, and a
sample space S ⊆X, we study the question:

How can we learn f within A by actively sampling observations within S?

Figure 1: Instances of transductive active
learning with target space A shown in
blue and sample space S shown in gray.
The points denote plausible observations
within S to “learn” A. In (A), the target
space contains “everything” within S
as well as points outside S. In (B, C,
D), one makes observations directed to-
wards learning about a particular target.
Prior work on inductive active learning
has focused on the instance A = S.

This problem is ubiquitous in real-world applications such
as safe Bayesian optimization, where S is a set of safe
parameters and A might represent parameters outside S
whose safety we want to infer.
Active fine-tuning of
neural networks is another example, where the target
space A represents the test set over which we want to
minimize risk, and the sample space S represents the
dataset from which we can retrieve data points to fine-tune
our model to A. Figure 1 visualizes some instances of
transductive active learning.

Whereas most prior work has focused on the “global” in-
ductive instance X = A = S, MacKay (1992) was the
first to consider specific target spaces A and proposed the
principle of selecting points in S to minimize the “poste-
rior uncertainty” about points in A. Since then, several
works have studied this principle empirically (e.g., Seo
et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2006; Bogunovic et al., 2016; Wang
et al., 2021; Kothawade et al., 2021; Bickford Smith et al.,
2023). In this work, we model f as a Gaussian process or
(equivalently) as a function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space, for which the above principle is analytically and
computationally tractable. Our contributions are:

• Theory (Section 3): We are the first to give rates for the uniform convergence of uncertainty
over the target space A to the smallest attainable value, given samples from the sample
space S (Theorems 3.2 and 3.3), Our results provide a theoretical justification for the
principle of minimizing posterior uncertainty in transductive active learning, and indicate
that transductive active learning can be more sample efficient than inductive active learning.

• Applications: We show that transductive active learning improves upon the state-of-the-art
in the batch-wise active fine-tuning of neural networks for image classification (Section 4)
and in safe Bayesian optimization (Section 5).

Problem Setting

We assume for now that the target space A and sample space S are finite, and relax these assumptions
in the appendices. We model f as a stochastic process and denote the marginal random variables f(x)
by fx, and joint random vectors {fx}x∈X for some X ⊆X, |X| < ∞by fX. Let yX denote the
noisy observations of fX, {yx = fx + εx}x∈X, where εx is independent noise.2 We study the
“adaptive” setting, where in round n the agent selects a point xn ∈S and observes yn = yxn. The
agent’s choice of xn may depend on the outcome of prior observations Dn−1
def
= {(xi, yi)}i<n.

Background on information theory
We briefly recap several important concepts from information
theory of which we provide formal definitions in Appendix B. The (differential) entropy H[f] is
one possible measure of uncertainty about f and the conditional entropy H[f | y] is the (expected)
posterior uncertainty about f after observing y. The information gain I(f; y) = H[f] −H[f | y]
measures the (expected) reduction in uncertainty about f due to y. We denote the information
gain about A from observing X by I(fA; yX). The maximum information gain about A from n
observations within S is
γA,S(n)
def
= max
X⊆S
|X|≤n
I(fA; yX).

This “information capacity” measures the information about fA that is accessible from within S, and
has been used previously (e.g., by Srinivas et al., 2009; Chowdhury & Gopalan, 2017; Vakili et al.,
2021) in the setting where X = A = S, taking the form of γn
def
= γX (n)
def
= γX,X (n). We remark that
γA,S(n) ≤γS(n) holds uniformly for all A, S, and n due to the data processing inequality. Generally,
γA,S(n) can be substantially smaller if the target space is a sparse subset of the sample space.

2X may be a multiset in which case repeated occurrence of x corresponds to independent observations of yx.

Main Results

We analyze the following principle for transductive active learning:

Select samples to minimize the posterior “uncertainty” about f within A.
(†)

This principle yields a family of simple and natural decision rules which depend on the chosen
measure of “uncertainty”. Two natural measures of uncertainty are (1) the entropy of prediction
targets, H[fA], and (2) their total variance, P

x′∈A Var[fx′]. The corresponding decision rules are

(1)
xn = arg min
x∈S
H[fA | Dn−1, yx] = arg max
x∈S
I(fA; yx | Dn−1),
(ITL)

(2)
xn = arg min
x∈S
tr Var[fA | Dn−1, yx]
(VTL)

with an implicit expectation over the feedback yx. That is, ITL (short for Information-based
Transductive Learning) and VTL (Variance-based TL) select xn so as to minimize the uncertainty
about the prediction targets fA (in expectation) after having received the feedback yn. Unlike
VTL, ITL takes into account the mutual dependence between points in A. These decision rules
were suggested previously (MacKay, 1992; Seo et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2006) without deriving
theoretical guarantees; and they generalize several widely used algorithms which we discuss in
more detail in Section 6. Most prominently, in the inductive setting where S ⊆A, ITL reduces to
xn = arg maxx∈S I(fx; yx | Dn−1), i.e., is “undirected” and reduces to standard uncertainty-based
active learning strategies (cf. Appendix C.1). The convergence properties for the special instance
of ITL with S = A have been studied extensively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to extend these guarantees to the more general setting of transductive active learning.

In our presented results, we make the following assumption.
Assumption 3.1. In the case of ITL, the information gain ψA(X) = I(fA; yX) is submodular. In
the case of VTL, the variance reduction ψA(X) = tr Var[fA] −tr Var[fA | yX] is submodular.
Under this assumption, ψA(x1:n) is a constant factor approximation of maxX⊆S,|X|≤n ψA(X) due
to the seminal result on submodular function maximization by Nemhauser et al. (1978). Similar
assumptions have been made, e.g., by Bogunovic et al. (2016) and Kothawade et al. (2021). Assump-
tion 3.1 is satisfied exactly for ITL when S ⊆A and f is a Gaussian process (cf. Lemma C.9), and
we provide an extensive discussion of our results in Appendix C.4 for instances where Assumption 3.1
is satisfied approximately, relying on the notion of weak submodularity (Das & Kempe, 2018).

3.1
Gaussian Process Setting

When f ∼GP(µ, k) is a Gaussian process (GP, Williams & Rasmussen, 2006) with known mean
function µ and kernel k, and the noise εx is mutually independent and zero-mean Gaussian with
known variance, the ITL and VTL objectives have a closed form expression (cf. Appendix F) and
can be optimized efficiently. Further, the information capacity γn is sublinear in n for a rich class
of GPs (Srinivas et al., 2009; Vakili et al., 2021), with rates summarized in Table 3 of the appendix.

Convergence to irreducible uncertainty
So far, our discussion was centered around the role of
the target space A in facilitating directed learning. An orthogonal contribution of this work is to
study extrapolation from the sample space S to points x ∈A \ S. To this end, we derive bounds
on the marginal posterior variance σ2
n(x)
def
= Var[f(x) | Dn] for points in A. These bounds depend
on the instance of transductive active learning (i.e., A and S) and might be of independent interest
for active learning. For ITL and VTL, they imply uniform convergence of the variance for a rich
class of GPs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present such bounds.

We define the irreducible uncertainty as the variance of f(x) provided complete knowledge of f in S:

η2
S(x)
def
= Var[fx | fS].

As the name suggests, η2
S(x) represents the smallest uncertainty one can hope to achieve from
observing only within S. For all x ∈S, it is easy to see that η2
S(x) = 0. However, the irreducible
uncertainty of x ̸∈S may be (and typically is!) strictly positive.
Theorem 3.2 (Bound on marginal variance for ITL and VTL). Let Assumption 3.1 hold and the
data be selected by either ITL or VTL.. Assume that f ∼GP(µ, k) with known mean function µ

and kernel k, the noise εx is mutually independent and zero-mean Gaussian with known variance,
and γn is sublinear in n. Then there exists a constant C such that for any n ≥1 and x ∈A,

σ2
n(x) ≤η2

Moreover, if x ∈A ∩S, there exists a constant C′ such that

σ2
n(x) ≤C′ γA,S(n)

n
.
(2)

Intuitively, Equation (1) of Theorem 3.2 can be understood as bounding an epistemic “generalization
gap” (Wainwright, 2019) of the learner. The reducible uncertainty converges to zero at all prediction
targets x ∈A, e.g., for linear, Gaussian, and smooth Matérn kernels. As to be expected, a smaller
target space (i.e., more targeted sampling) leads to faster convergence due to a smaller information
capacity γA,S(n) ≪γn. Equation (2) matches prior results for the setting S = A. We provide a
formal proof of Theorem 3.2 in Appendix C.6.

3.2
Agnostic Setting

The result from the GP setting translates also to the agnostic setting, where the “ground truth” f ⋆may
be any sufficiently regular fixed function on X.3 In this case, we use the model f from Section 3.1
as a (misspecified) model of f ⋆, with some kernel k and zero mean function µ(·) = 0. We denote
by µn(x) = E[f(x) | Dn] the posterior mean of f. W.l.o.g. we assume in the following result that
the prior variance is bounded, i.e., Var[f(x)] ≤1.
Theorem 3.3 (Bound on approximation error for ITL and VTL, following Abbasi-Yadkori (2013);
Chowdhury & Gopalan (2017)). Let Assumption 3.1 hold and the data be selected by either ITL or
VTL. Pick any δ ∈(0, 1). Assume that f ⋆lies in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space Hk(X) of the
kernel k with norm ∥f ⋆∥k < ∞, the noise εn is conditionally ρ-sub-Gaussian, and γn is sublinear
in n. Let βn(δ) = ∥f ⋆∥k + ρ
p

2(γn + 1 + log(1/δ)). Then for any n ≥1 and x ∈A, jointly with
probability at least 1 −δ,

|f ⋆(x) −µn(x)| ≤βn(δ)

i

where ν2
A,S(n) denotes the reducible part of Equation (1).

We provide a formal proof of Theorem 3.3 in Appendix C.7. Theorem 3.3 generalizes approximation
error bounds of prior works to the extrapolation setting, where some prediction targets x ∈A lie
outside the sample space S. For prediction targets x ∈A ∩S, the irreducible uncertainty vanishes,
and we recover previous results from the setting S = A.

Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 show that ITL and VTL efficiently learn f at the prediction targets A for large
classes of “sufficiently regular” functions f. In the following, we validate these results experimentally
by showing that ITL and VTL exhibit strong empirical performance in a broad range of applications.

3.3
Experiments in the Gaussian Process Setting

Before demonstrating ITL and VTL on GPs to develop more intuition, we introduce a natural
correlation-based baseline, which will later uncover connections to existing approaches:

xn = arg max
x∈S

X

x′∈A
Cor[fx, fx′ | Dn−1].
(CTL)

How does the smoothness of f affect ITL?
We contrast two “extreme” kernels: the Gaussian
kernel k(x, x′) = exp(−∥x −x′∥2
2 /2) and the Laplace kernel k(x, x′) = exp(−∥x −x′∥1).
In the mean-squared sense, the Gaussian kernel yields a smooth process f whereas the Laplace
kernel yields a continuous but non-differentiable f (Williams & Rasmussen, 2006). Figure 2 shows

from Figure 2. It can be seen that ITL and VTL outperform UNSA and RANDOM. Uncertainty bands
correspond to one standard error over 10 random seeds.

how ITL adapts to the smoothness of f: Under the “smooth” Gaussian kernel, points outside A
provide higher-order information. In contrast, under the “rough” Laplace kernel and if A ⊆S,
points outside A do not provide any additional information, and therefore are not sampled by ITL.
If, however, A ̸⊆S, information “leaks” A even under a Laplace kernel prior. That is, even for
non-smooth functions, the point with most information need not be in A.

Does ITL outperform uncertainty sampling?
Uncertainty sampling (UNSA, Lewis & Catlett,
1994) is one of the most popular active learning methods. UNSA selects points x with high prior uncer-
tainty: xn = arg maxx∈S σ2
n−1(x). This is in stark contrast to ITL and VTL which select points x
that minimize posterior (epistemic) uncertainty about A. It can be seen that UNSA is the special
“undirected” case of ITL when S ⊆A and observation noise is homoscedastic (cf. Appendix C.1).

We compare UNSA to ITL, VTL, and CTL in Figure 3. We observe that ITL and VTL outperform
UNSA which also samples points that are not informative about A.
Further, ITL and VTL
outperform “local” UNSA (i.e., UNSA constrained to A ∩S) which neglects all information provided
by points outside A.4 As one would expect, VTL has an advantage with respect to reducing the total
variance of fA, whereas ITL reduces the entropy of fA faster. We include ablations in Appendix H
where we, in particular, observe that the advantage of ITL and VTL over UNSA increases as the
volume of prediction targets shrinks in comparison to the size of domain.

Active Fine-Tuning of Neural Networks

Fine-tuning a large pre-trained model is a cost- and computation-effective approach to improve
performance on a given target domain (Lee et al., 2022). While previous work has studied the
effectiveness of various training procedures for fine-tuning (e.g., Eustratiadis et al., 2024), we ask:
How can we select the right data for fine-tuning to a specific task? This active fine-tuning problem
is an instance of the introduced “directed” transductive learning problem: Concretely, consider a
supervised setting, where the function f maps inputs x ∈X to outputs y ∈Y. We have access

4If A ̸⊆S then “local” UNSA does not even converge to the irreducible uncertainty.

5


---Page Break---
to noisy samples from a training set S on X, and we would like to learn f such that our estimate
minimizes a given risk measure, such as classification error, with respect to a test distribution PA
on X. The goal is to actively and efficiently sample from S to minimize risk with respect to PA.5
We show in this section that ITL and VTL can learn f from only few examples from S.

How can we leverage the latent structure learned by the pre-trained model?
As common in
related work, we approximate the (pre-trained) neural network (NN) f(·; θ) as a linear function in a
latent embedding space, f(x; θ) ≈β⊤ϕθ(x), with weights β ∈Rp and embeddings ϕθ : X →Rp.
Common choices of embeddings include last-layer embeddings (Devlin et al., 2019; Holzmüller
et al., 2023), neural tangent embeddings arising from neural tangent kernels (Jacot et al., 2018)
which are motivated by their relationship to the training and fine-tuning of ultra-wide NNs (Arora
et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019; Khan et al., 2019; He et al., 2020; Malladi et al., 2023), and loss
gradient embeddings (Ash et al., 2020). We provide a comprehensive overview of embeddings in
Appendix J.2. Now, supposing the prior β ∼N(0, Σ), often with Σ = I (Khan et al., 2019; He
et al., 2020; Antorán et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022), this approximation of f is a Gaussian process
with kernel k(x, x′) = ϕθ(x)⊤Σϕθ(x′) which quantifies the similarity between points in terms of
their alignment in the learned latent space. Note that the correlation k(x, x′)/
p

k(x, x)k(x′, x′)
between two points x, x′ is equal to the cosine similarity of their embeddings.

In this context, Theorem 3.2 bounds the epistemic posterior uncertainty about a prediction using
the approximation β⊤ϕθ(x), given that the model is trained using data selected by ITL or VTL.
Theorem 3.3 bounds the generalization error when using the posterior mean of β for prediction. This
extends recent work which has studied estimators of this generalization error (Wei et al., 2022).

Batch selection: Diversity via conditional embeddings
Efficient labeling and training necessitates
a batch-wise selection of inputs. The selection of a batch of size b > 1 can be seen as an individual
non-adaptive active learning problem, and significant recent work has shown that batch diversity
is crucial in this setting (Ash et al., 2020; Zanette et al., 2021; Holzmüller et al., 2023; Pacchiano
et al., 2024). An information-based batch-wise selection strategy is formalized by the following non-
adaptive transductive active learning problem (Chen & Krause, 2013) and the greedy approximation
of Bn by ITL which selects elements xn,i of the n-th batch iteratively based on xn,1:i−1:

Bn = arg max
B⊆S,|B|=b
I(fA; yB | Dn−1);
xn,i = arg max
x∈S
I(fA; yx | Dn−1, yxn,1:i−1).
(3)

The batch Bn is diverse and informative by design. We show that under Assumption 3.1, B′
n = xn,1:b
yields a constant-factor approximation of Bn (cf. Appendix C.3).

4.1
Experiments on Active Fine-Tuning

Our empirical evaluation is motivated by the following practical example: We deploy a pre-trained
image classifier to user’s phones who use it within their local environment. We would like to locally
fine-tune a user’s model to their environment. Since the users’ images A are unlabeled, this requires
selecting a small number of relevant and diverse images from the set of labeled images S. As
such, we will focus here on the setting where the points in our test set do not lie in our training
set (i.e., A ∩S = ∅), and discuss alternative instances such as active domain adaptation in Appendix I.

Testbeds & architectures
We use the MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998) and CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky
et al., 2009) datasets as testbeds. In both cases, we take S to be the training set, and we consider the
task of learning the digits 3, 6, and 9 (MNIST) or the first 10 categories of CIFAR-100.6 For MNIST,
we train a simple convolutional neural network with ReLU activations, three convolutional layers
with max-pooling, and two fully-connected layers. For CIFAR-100, we fine-tune an EfficientNet-B0
(Tan & Le, 2019) pre-trained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), augmented by a final fully-connected
layer. We train the NNs using the cross-entropy loss and the ADAM optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014).

Results
In Figure 4, We compare against (i) active learning methods which largely aim for sample
diversity but which are not directed towards the target distribution PA (e.g., BADGE; Ash et al., 2020),
and (ii) search methods that aim to retrieve the most relevant samples from S with respect to the
targets PA (e.g., maximizing cosine similarity to target embeddings as is common in vector databases;

5The setting with target distributions PA can be reduced to considering target sets A (cf. Appendix E).
6That is, we restrict PA to the support of points with labels {3, 6, 9} (MNIST) or labels {0, . . . , 9} (CIFAR-
100) and train a neural network using few examples drawn from the training set S.

Figure 4: Active fine-tuning on MNIST (left) and CIFAR-100 (right). RANDOM selects each
observation uniformly at random from S. The batch size is 1 for MNIST and 10 for CIFAR-100.
Uncertainty bands correspond to one standard error over 10 random seeds. We see that transductive
active learning with ITL and VTL significantly outperforms competing methods, and in particular,
retrieves substantially more samples from the support of PA. See Appendix J for details and ablations.

Settles & Craven, 2008; Johnson et al., 2019). INFORMATIONDENSITY (ID, Settles & Craven, 2008)
is a heuristic approach aiming to combine (i) diversity and (ii) relevance. In Appendix J.5, we also
compare against a wide range of additional baselines (e.g., CORESET (Sener & Savarese, 2017),
TYPICLUST (Hacohen et al., 2022), PROBCOVER (Yehuda et al., 2022), etc.) that fall into one of the
categories (i) and (ii), and which perform similar to the baselines listed here.

We observe that ITL, VTL, and CTL consistently and significantly outperform random sampling
from S as well as all baselines. We see that relevance-based methods such as COSINESIMILARITY
have an initial advantage over RANDOM but for batch sizes larger than 1 they quickly fall behind
due to diminishing informativeness of the selected data. In contrast, diversity-based methods such as
BADGE are more competitive with RANDOM but do not explicitly aim to retrieve relevant samples.

Remarkably, transductive active learning outperforms random data selection even in the MNIST
experiment where the model is randomly initialized. This suggests that the learned embeddings can be
informative for data selection even in the early stages of training, bootstrapping the learning progress.

Balancing sample relevance and diversity
Our proposed methods unify approaches to coverage
(promoting diverse samples) and search (aiming for relevant samples with respect to a given query A)
which leads to the significant improvement upon the state-of-the-art in Figure 4. Notably, for a batch
size and query size of 1 and if correlations are non-negative, ITL, VTL, CTL, and the canonical
cosine similarity are equivalent. CTL can be seen as a direct generalization of cosine similarity-based
retrieval to batch and query sizes larger than one. In contrast to CTL, ITL and VTL may also sample
points which exhibit a strong negative correlation (which is also informative).

We observe empirically that ITL obtains samples from PA at more than twice the rate of COSINES-
IMILARITY, which translates to a significant improvement in accuracy in more difficult learning
tasks, while requiring fewer (labeled) samples from S. This phenomenon manifests for both MNIST
and CIFAR-100, as well as imbalanced datasets S or imbalanced reference samples from PA (cf.
Appendix J.6). The improvement in accuracy appears to increase in the large-data regime, where the
learning tasks become more difficult. Akin to a previously identified scaling trend with size of the pre-
training dataset (Tamkin et al., 2022), this suggests a potential scaling trend where the improvement
of ITL over random batch selection grows as models are fine-tuned on a larger pool of data.

Towards task-driven few-shot learning
Being able to efficiently and automatically select data
may allow dynamic few-shot fine-tuning to individual tasks (Vinyals et al., 2016; Hardt & Sun,
2024), e.g., fine-tuning the model to each test point / query / prompt. Such task-driven few-shot
learning can be seen as a form of “memory recall” akin to associative memory (Hopfield, 1982).
Our results are a first indication that task-driven learning can lead to substantial performance gains,
and we believe that this is a promising direction for future studies.

Safe Bayesian Optimization

Another practical problem that can be cast as “directed” learning is safe Bayesian optimization (Safe
BO, Sui et al., 2015; Berkenkamp et al., 2021) which has applications in natural science (Cooper &
Netoff, 2022) and robotics (Wischnewski et al., 2019; Sukhija et al., 2023; Widmer et al., 2023). Safe
BO solves the following optimization problem
max
x∈S⋆f ⋆(x)
where
S⋆= {x ∈X | g⋆(x) ≥0}
(4)

which can be generalized to multiple constraints. The functions f ⋆and g⋆, and hence also the “safe
set” S⋆, are unknown and have to be actively learned from data. However, it is crucial that the data
collection does not violate the constraint, i.e., xn ∈S⋆, ∀n ≥1.

Safe Bayesian optimization as Transductive Active Learning
In the agnostic setting from
Section 3.2, GPs f and g can be used as well-calibrated models of the ground truths f ⋆and g⋆,
and we denote lower- and upper-confidence bounds by lf
n(x), lg
n(x) and uf
n(x), ug
n(x), respectively.
These confidence bounds induce a pessimistic safe set Sn
def
= {x | lg
n(x) ≥0} and an optimistic safe
set bSn
def
= {x | ug
n(x) ≥0} which satisfy Sn ⊆S⋆⊆bSn with high probability at all times. Similarly,
the set of potential maximizers

An
def
= {x ∈bSn | uf
n(x) ≥max
x′∈Sn
lf
n(x′)}
(5)

contains the solution to Equation (4) at all times with high probability.

The (simple) regret rn(S)
def
= maxx∈S f ⋆(x) −f ⋆(bxn) with bxn
def
= arg maxx∈Sn lf
n(x) measures
the worst-case performance of a decision rule. To achieve small regret, one faces an exploration-
expansion dilemma wherein one needs to explore points that are known-to-be-safe, i.e., lie in the
estimated safe set Sn, and might be optimal, while at the same time discovering new safe points by “ex-
panding” Sn. Accordingly, a natural choice for the target space of Safe BO is An since it captures both
exploration and expansion simultaneously.7 To prevent constraint violation, the sample space is re-
stricted to the pessimistic safe set Sn. In Safe BO, both the target space and sample space change with
each round n, and we generalize our theoretical results from Section 3 in Appendix C to this setting.
Theorem 5.1 (Convergence to safe optimum). Pick any ϵ > 0, δ ∈(0, 1). Assume that f ⋆, g⋆lie in
the reproducing kernel Hilbert space Hk(X) of the kernel k, and that the noise εn is conditionally
ρ-sub-Gaussian. Then, we have with probability at least 1 −δ,

Safety: for all n ≥1,
xn ∈S⋆.

Moreover, assume S0 ̸= ∅and denote with R the largest reachable safe set starting from S0. Then,
the convergence of reducible uncertainty implies that there exists n⋆> 0 such that with probability
at least 1 −δ,

Optimality: for all n ≥n⋆,
rn(R) ≤ϵ.

We provide a formal proof in Appendix C.8. Central to the proof is the application of Theorem 3.3 to
show that the safety of parameters outside the safe set Sn can be inferred efficiently. In Section 3, we
outline settings where the reducible uncertainty converges which is the case for a very general class of
functions, and for such instances Theorem 5.1 guarantees optimality in the largest reachable safe set
R. R represents the largest set any safe learning algorithm can explore without violating the safety
constraints (with high probability) during learning (cf. Definition C.29). Our guarantees are similar
to those of other Safe BO algorithms (Berkenkamp et al., 2021) but require fewer assumptions and
generalize to continuous domains. We obtain Theorem 5.1 from a more general result (Theorem C.34)
which can be specialized to yield “free” novel convergence guarantees for problems other than
Bayesian optimization, such as level set estimation, by choosing an appropriate target space.

7An alternative possibility is to weigh each point in An according to how likely it is to be the safe optimum.
Which approach performs better is task-dependent, and we include a detailed discussion in Appendix K.1.

SAFEOPT

ORACLE SAFEOPT
HEURISTIC SAFEOPT

Figure 5: We compare ITL and VTL to ORACLE SAFEOPT, which has oracle knowledge of the
Lipschitz constants, SAFEOPT, where the Lipschitz constants are estimated from the GP, as well as
HEURISTIC SAFEOPT and ISE, and observe that ITL and VTL systematically perform well. We
compare against additional baselines in Appendix K.1. The regret is evaluated with respect to the
ground truth objective f ⋆and constraint g⋆, and averaged over 10 (in synthetic experiments) and 25
(in the quadcopter experiment) random seeds. Additional details can be found in Appendix K.4.

5.1
Experiments on Safe Bayesian Optimization

We evaluate two synthetic experiments for a 1d and 2d parameter space, respectively (cf. Ap-
pendix K.4 for details), which demonstrate the various shortcomings of existing Safe BO baselines.
Additionally, as third experiment, we safely tune the controller of a quadcopter.

Safe controller tuning for a quadcopter
We consider a quadcopter with unknown dynamics;
st+1 = T (st, ut) where ut ∈Rdu is the control signal and st ∈Rds is the state at time t. The
inputs ut are calculated through a deterministic function of the state π : S →U which we call
the policy. The policy is parameterized via parameters x ∈X, e.g., PID controller gains, such that
ut = πx(st). The goal is to find the optimal parameters with respect to an unknown objective f ⋆
while satisfying some unknown constraint(s) g⋆(x) ≥0, e.g., the quadcopter does not fall on the
ground. This is a typical Safe BO problem which is widely applied for safe controller learning in
robotics (Berkenkamp et al., 2021; Baumann et al., 2021; Widmer et al., 2023).

Results
We compare ITL and VTL to SAFEOPT (Berkenkamp et al., 2021), which is undirected,
i.e., expands in all directions including ones that are known-to-be suboptimal, and ISE (Bottero
et al., 2022), which is solely expansionist — does not trade-off expansion-exploration. We provide a
detailed discussion of baselines in Appendix K.2. In all our experiments, summarized in Figure 5, we
observe that ITL and VTL systematically perform well, i.e., better or on par with the state-of-the-art.
We attribute this to its directed exploration and less conservative expansion over SAFEOPT (cf. 1d
task and quadcopter experiment), and natural trade-off between expansion and exploration as opposed
to ISE (see 2d task). Generally, VTL has a slight advantage over ITL, which is because VTL
minimizes marginal variances (as opposed to entropy), which are decisive for expanding the safe set.
While ITL and VTL do not violate constraints, we observe that other methods that do not explicitly
enforce safety such as EIC (Gardner et al., 2014) lead to constraint violation (cf. Appendix K.4.2).

(Inductive) active learning
The special case of transductive active learning where A = S = X
has been widely studied. We refer to this special instance as inductive active learning, since the goal
is to extract as much information as possible as opposed to making predictions on a specific target set.

Several works have previously found entropy-based decision rules to be useful for inductive active
learning (Krause & Guestrin, 2007; Guo & Greiner, 2007; Krause et al., 2008) and semi-supervised
learning (Grandvalet & Bengio, 2004). The variance-based VTL has previously been proposed by
Cohn (1993) in the special case of inductive active learning without proving theoretical guarantees.
VTL was then recently re-derived by Shoham & Avron (2023) along other experimental design

---Page Break---
criteria under the lens of minimizing risk for inductive one-shot learning in overparameterized
models. Substantial work on active learning has studied entropy-based criteria in parameter-space,
most notably BALD (MacKay, 1992; Houlsby et al., 2011; Gal et al., 2017; Kirsch et al., 2019),
which selects xn = arg maxx∈X I(θ; yx | Dn−1), where θ is the random parameter vector of a
parametric model (e.g., obtained via Bayesian deep learning). Such methods are inherently inductive
in the sense that they do not facilitate learning on specific prediction targets.

Transductive active learning
In contrast, ITL operates in output-space where it is straightforward
to specify prediction targets, and which is computationally easier. Special cases of ITL when
S = X and |A| = 1 have been proposed in the foundational work of MacKay (1992) on “directed”
output-space active learning. As generalization to larger target spaces, MacKay (1992) proposed
mean-marginal ITL,

xn = arg max
x∈S

X

x′∈A
I(fx′; yx | Dn−1) ,
(MM-ITL)

for which we derive analogous versions of Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 in Appendix D.3. We note that
similarly to VTL, MM-ITL disregards the mutual dependence of points in the target space A and
differs from VTL only in a different weighting of the posterior marginal variances of the prediction
targets (cf. Appendix D.3). Recently, Bickford Smith et al. (2023) generalized MM-ITL by treating
the prediction target as a random variable, and Kothawade et al. (2021) and Bickford Smith et al.
(2024) demonstrated the use of output-space decision rules for image classification tasks in a
pre-training context.

Influence functions
measure the change in a model’s prediction when a single data point is removed
from the training data (Cook, 1977; Koh & Liang, 2017; Pruthi et al., 2019). Influence functions have
been used for data selection in settings closely related to the transductive active fine-tuning of neural
networks proposed in this work (Xia et al., 2024). They select data that reduces a first-order Taylor
approximation to the test loss after fine-tuning a neural network, which corresponds to maximizing
cosine similarity to the prediction targets in a loss-gradient embedding space. We show in our ex-
periments that transductive active learning can substantially outperform COSINESIMILARITY. We at-
tribute this primarily to influence functions implicitly assuming that the influence of selected data adds
linearly (i.e., two equally scored data points are expected to doubly improve the model performance,
Xu & Kazantsev, 2019, Section 3.2). This assumption does not hold in practice as seen, e.g., by simply
duplicating data. The same limitation applies to the related approach of datamodels (Ilyas et al., 2022).

Other work on directed active learning
Directed active learning methods have been proposed
for the problem of determining the optimum of an unknown function, also known as best-arm
identification (Audibert et al., 2010) or pure exploration bandits (Bubeck et al., 2009). Entropy
search methods (Hennig & Schuler, 2012; Hernández-Lobato et al., 2014) are widely used and select
xn = arg maxx∈X I(x∗; yx | Dn−1) in input-space where x∗= arg maxx fx. Similarly to ITL,
output-space entropy search methods (Hoffman & Ghahramani, 2015; Wang & Jegelka, 2017), which
select xn = arg maxx∈X I(f ∗; yx | Dn−1) with f ∗= maxx fx, are more computationally tractable.
In fact, output-space entropy search is a special case of ITL with a stochastic target space (cf. Equa-
tion (47) in Appendix K.1). Bogunovic et al. (2016) analyze TRUVAR in the context of Bayesian
optimization and level set estimation. TRUVAR is akin to VTL with a similar notion of “target space”,
but their algorithm and analysis rely on a threshold scheme which requires that A ⊆S. Fiez et al.
(2019) introduce the transductive linear bandit problem, which is a special case of transductive active
learning limited to a linear function class and with the objective of determining the maximum within
an initial candidate set.8 We mention additional more loosely related works in Appendix A.

Conclusion

We investigated the generalization of active learning to settings with concrete prediction targets
and/or with limited information due to constrained sample spaces. This provides a flexible framework,
applicable also to other domains than were discussed (such as recommender systems, molecular
design, robotics, etc.) by varying the choice of target space and sample space. Further, we proved
novel generalization bounds which may be of independent interest for active learning. Finally, we
demonstrated across broad applications that sampling relevant and diverse points (as opposed to
only one of the two) leads to a substantial improvement upon the state-of-the-art.

8The transductive bandit problem can be solved analogously to Safe BO, by maintaining the set An.

Appendices

A general principle of “transductive learning” was already formulated by the famous computer
scientist Vladimir Vapnik in the 20th century. Vapnik proposes the following “imperative for a
complex world”:

When solving a problem of interest, do not solve a more general problem as an intermediate step. Try
to get the answer that you really need but not a more general one.

Additional Related Work

The general principle of non-active “transductive learning” was introduced by Vapnik (1982). The no-
tion of “target” from transductive active learning is akin to the notion of “task” in curriculum learning
(Bengio et al., 2009; Graves et al., 2017; Soviany et al., 2022). The study of settings where the irre-
ducible uncertainty is zero is related to the study of estimability in experimental design (Graybill, 1961;
Mutny & Krause, 2022). In feature selection, selecting features that maximize information gain with
respect to a to-be-predicted label is a standard approach (Peng et al., 2005; Vergara & Estévez, 2014;
Beraha et al., 2019) which is akin to ITL (cf. Appendix D). The themes of relevance and diversity
are also important for efficient in-context learning (e.g., Ye et al., 2023; Kumari et al., 2024) and data
pruning (Zheng et al., 2023). Transductive active learning is complimentary to other learning method-
ologies, such as semi-supervised learning (Gao et al., 2020), self-supervised learning (Shwartz-Ziv &
LeCun, 2023; Balestriero et al., 2023), and meta-learning (Kaddour et al., 2020; Rothfuss et al., 2023).

Background

B.1
Information Theory

Throughout this work, log denotes the natural logarithm. Given random vectors x and y, we denote by

H[x]
def
= Ep(x)[−log p(x)],

H[x | y]
def
= Ep(x,y)[−log p(x | y)],
and

I(x; y)
def
= H[x] −H[x | y]

the (differential) entropy, conditional entropy, and information gain, respectively (Cover, 1999).9

The multivariate information gain (Murphy, 2023) between random vectors x, y, z is given by

I(x; y; z)
def
= I(x; y) −I(x; y | z)
(6)
= I(x; y) + I(x; z) −I(x; y, z).
(7)

When I(x; y; z) ̸= 0 it is said that y and z interact regarding their information about x. If the
interaction is positive, it is said that the information of z about x is redundant given y. Conversely,
if the interaction is negative, it is said that the information of z about x is synergistic with y. The
notion of synergy is akin to the frequentist notion of “suppressor variables” in linear regression (Das
& Kempe, 2008).

B.2
Gaussian Processes

The stochastic process f is a Gaussian process (GP, Williams & Rasmussen (2006)), denoted
f ∼GP(µ, k), with mean function µ and kernel k if for any finite subset X = {x1, . . . , xn} ⊆X,
fX ∼N(µX, KXX) is jointly Gaussian with mean vector µX(i) = µ(xi) and covariance
matrix KXX(i, j) = k(xi, xj).

In the following, we formalize the assumptions from the GP setting (cf. Section 3.1).
Assumption B.1 (Gaussian prior). We assume that f ∼GP(µ, k) with known mean function µ and
kernel k.
Assumption B.2 (Gaussian noise). We assume that the noise εx is mutually independent and
zero-mean Gaussian with known variance ρ2(x) > 0. We write PX = diag ρ2(x1), . . . , ρ2(xn).

Under Assumptions B.1 and B.2, the posterior distribution of f after observing points X is
GP(µn, kn) with

µn(x) = µ(x) + KxX(KXX + PX)−1(yX −µX),

kn(x, x′) = k(x, x′) −KxX(KXX + PX)−1KXx′,

σ2
n(x) = kn(x, x).

9One has to be careful to ensure that I(x; y) exists, i.e., |I(x; y)| < ∞. We will assume that this is the case
throughout this work. When x and y are jointly Gaussian, this is satisfied when the noise variance ρ2 is positive.

The following is a brief overview of the structure of this section:

1. Appendix C.1 relates ITL in the inductive learning setting (S ⊆A) to prior work.
2. Appendix C.2 relates the designs selected by ITL and VTL to the optimal designs for
corresponding non-adaptive objectives.
3. Appendix C.3 shows that batch selection via ITL or VTL leads to informative and diverse
batches, utilizing the results from Appendix C.2.
4. Appendix C.4 introduces measures of synergies that generalize the submodularity assump-
tion (cf. Assumption 3.1).
5. Appendix C.5 proves key results on the convergence of the ITL and VTL objectives.
6. Appendix C.6 proves Theorem 3.2 (convergence in GP setting).
7. Appendix C.7 proves Theorem 3.3 (convergence in agnostic setting).
8. Appendix C.8 proves Theorem 5.1 (convergence in safe BO application).
9. Appendix C.9 includes useful facts.

C.1
Undirected Case of ITL

We briefly examine the important special case of ITL where S ⊆A. In this setting, for all x ∈S,
the decision rule of ITL simplifies to

I(fA; yx | Dn)
(i)
= I(fA\{x}; yx | fx, Dn) + I(fx; yx | Dn)

(ii)
= I(fx; yx | Dn)
= H[yx | Dn] −H[εx]

where (i) follows from the chain rule of information gain and x ∈S ⊆A; and (ii) follows from the
conditional independence fA ⊥yx | fx.

If additionally f is a GP then

H[yx | Dn] −H[εx] = 1

2 log

1 + Var[fx | Dn]

Var[εx]


.

This decision rule has also been termed total information gain (MacKay, 1992). When S ⊆A and
observation noise is homoscedastic, this decision rule is equivalent to uncertainty sampling.

C.2
Non-adaptive Data Selection & Submodularity

Recall the non-myopic information gain ψA(X) = I(fA; yX) (ITL) and variance reduction
ψA(X) = tr Var[fA] −tr Var[fA | yX] (VTL) objective functions from Assumption 3.1. In this
section, we will relate the designs selected by ITL and VTL to the optimal designs for these objectives.
To this end, consider the non-adaptive optimization problem

X⋆= arg max
X⊆S
|X|=k

ψA(X).

21


---Page Break---
Lemma C.1. For both ITL and VTL, ψA is non-negative and monotone.

Proof. For ITL, ψA(X) ≥0 follows from the non-negativity of mutual information. To conclude
monotonicity, note that for any X′ ⊆X ⊆S,

I(fA; yX′) = H[fA] −H[fA | yX′] ≤H[fA] −H[fA | yX] = I(fA; yX)

due to monotonicity of conditional entropy (which is also called the “information never hurts”
principle).

For VTL, recall that tr Var[fA | yX] ≤tr Var[fA | yX′] for any X′ ⊆X ⊆S (with an implicit ex-
pectation over yX, yX′). Non-negativity and monotonicity of ψA then follow analogously to ITL.

Lemma C.2. The marginal gain ∆A(x | X)
def
= ψA(X ∪{x}) −ψA(X) of x ∈S given X ⊆S is
the ITL and VTL objective, respectively.

Proof. For ITL,

∆A(x | X) = I(fA; yX, yx) −I(fA; yX)
= H[fA | yX] −H[fA | yX, yx]
= I(fA; yx | yX)

which is precisely the ITL objective.

For VTL,

∆A(x | X) = tr Var[fA | yX] −tr Var[fA | yX, yx]
= −tr Var[fA | yX, yx] + const

which is precisely the VTL objective.

Definition C.3 (Submodularity). ψA is submodular if and only if for all x ∈S and X′ ⊆X ⊆S,

∆A(x | X′) ≥∆A(x | X).

Theorem C.4 (Nemhauser et al. (1978)). Let Assumption 3.1 hold. For any n ≥1, if ITL or VTL
selected x1:n, respectively, then
ψA(x1:n) ≥(1 −1/e) max
X⊆S
|X|≤n
ψA(X).

Proof. This is a special case of a canonical result from non-negative monotone submodular function
maximization (Nemhauser et al., 1978; Krause & Golovin, 2014).

C.3
Batch Diversity: Batch Selection as Non-adaptive Data Selection

Recall the non-adaptive optimization problem

Bn,k = arg max
B⊆S
|B|=k

I(fA; yB | Dn−1)

from Equation (3) with batch size k > 0, and denote by B′
n,k = xn,1:k the greedy approximation from
Equation (3). The selection of an individual batch can be seen as a single non-adaptive optimization
problem with marginal gain

∆n(x | B) = I(fA; yB, yx | Dn−1) −I(fA; yB | Dn−1)
= H[fA | Dn−1, yB] −H[fA | Dn−1, yB, yx]
= I(fA; yx | Dn−1, yB)

and which is precisely the objective function of ITL from Equation (3). Hence, the approximation
guarantees from Theorems C.4 and C.11 apply. The derivation is analogous for VTL.

Prior work has shown that the greedy solution B′
n is also competitive with a fully sequential
“batchless” decision rule (Chen & Krause, 2013; Esfandiari et al., 2021).

C.4
Measures of Synergies & Approximate Submodularity

We will now show that “downstream synergies”, if present, can be seen as a source of learning
complexity, which is orthogonal to the information capacity γn.

Example C.5. Consider the example where f is a stochastic process of three random variables
X, Y, Z where X and Y are Bernoulli (p =
1
2), and Z is the XOR of X and Y . Suppose that
observations are exact (i.e., εn = 0), that the target space A comprises the output variable Z while
the sample space S comprises the input variables X and Y . Observing any single X or Y yields
no information about Z: I(Z; X) = I(Z; Y ) = 0, however, observing both inputs jointly perfectly
determines Z: I(Z; X, Y ) = 1. Thus, γn(A; S) = 1 if n ≥2 and γn(A; S) = 0 else.

Learning about Z in examples of this kind is difficult for agents that make decisions greedily,
since the next action (observing X or Y ) yields no signal about its long-term usefulness. We call
a sequence of observations, such as {X, Y }, synergistic since its combined information value is
larger than the individual values. The prevalence of synergies is not captured by the information
capacity γn(A; S) since it measures only the joint information gain of n samples within S. Instead,
the prevalence of synergies is captured by the sequence Γn
def
= maxx∈S ∆A(x | x1:n), which
measures the maximum information gain of yn+1. If Γn > Γn−1 at any round n, this indicates a
synergy. The following key object measures the additional complexity due to synergies.

Definition C.6 (Task complexity). For n ≥1, assuming Γi > 0 for all 1 ≤i ≤n, we define the task
complexity as

αA,S(n)
def
=
max
i∈{0,...,n−1}
Γn−1

Γi
.

Note that αA,S(n) is large only if the information gain of yn is larger than that of a previous
observation yi. Intuitively, if αA,S(n) is large, the agent had to discover the implicit intermediate
observations y1, . . . , yn−1 that lead to downstream synergies. We will subsequently formalize
the intimate connections of the task complexity to synergies and submodularity. Note that in the
GP setting, αA,S(n) can be computed online by keeping track of the smallest Γi during previous
rounds i. Further, note that αA,S(n) ≤1 if ψA is submodular.

C.4.1
The Information Ratio

Another object will prove useful in our analysis of synergies.

Consider an alternative multiplicative interpretation of the multivariate information gain (cf. Equa-
tion (7)), which we call the information ratio of X ⊆S given D ⊆S, |X|, |D| < ∞:

¯κ(X | D)
def
=
P

x∈X ∆A(x | D)

∆A(X | D)
∈[0, ∞).
(8)

Observe that ¯κ(X | D) measures the synergy properties of yX with respect to fA given yD in a
multiplicative sense. That is, if ¯κ(X | D) > 1 then information in yX is redundant, whereas if
¯κ(X | D) < 1 then information in yX is synergistic, and if ¯κ(X | D) = 1 then yX do not mutually
interact with respect to fA (all given yD). In the degenerate case where ∆A(X | D) = 0 (which
implies P

x∈X ∆A(x | D) = 0) we therefore let ¯κ(X | D) = 1.

The information ratio of ITL is strictly positive in the Gaussian case
We prove the following
straightforward lower bound to the information ratio of ITL.

Lemma C.7. Let X, D ⊆S, |X|, |D| < ∞.
If fA and yX∪D are jointly Gaussian then
¯κ(X | D) > 0.

Proof. W.l.o.g. assume D = ∅. We let X = {x1, . . . , xk} and prove lower and upper bound sep-
arately. We assume w.l.o.g. that I(fA; yX) > 0 which implies |Var[fA | yX]| < |Var[fA]|. Thus,
there exists some i such that fA and yxi are dependent, so |Var[fA | yxi]| < |Var[fA]| which implies
I(fA; yxi) > 0. We therefore conclude that ¯κ(X) > 0.

The following example shows that this lower bound is tight.

Example C.8 (Synergies of Gaussian random variables, inspired by Section 3 of Barrett (2015)).
Consider the three random variables X, Y , and Z (think A = {X} and S = {Y, Z}) which are
jointly Gaussian with mean vector 0 and covariance matrix

Σ =

"1
a
a

a

#

,
for 2a2 < 1

where the constraint on a is to ensure that Σ is positive definite. Computing the mutual information,
we have

I(X; Y ) = I(X; Z) = −1

2 log(1 −a2)

and I(X; Y, Z) = −1

2 log(1 −2a2). Therefore,
I(X; Y ) + I(X; Z)

I(X; Y, Z)
= log(1 −2a2 + a4)

log(1 −2a2)
< 1.

Note that

lim
a→1
√

2

log(1 −2a2 + a4)

log(1 −2a2)
= 0,

and hence — perhaps unintuitively — even if Y and Z are uncorrelated, their information about
X may be arbitrarily synergistic.

C.4.2
The Submodularity of the Special “Undirected” Case of ITL

In the inductive active learning problem considered in most prior works, where S ⊆A and f is a
Gaussian process, it holds for ITL that αA,S(n) = 1 since all learning targets appear explicitly in S:
Lemma C.9. Let S ⊆A. Then ψA of ITL is submodular.

Proof. Fix any x ∈S and X′ ⊆X ⊆S. Let ¯X
def
= X \ X′. By the definition of conditional
information gain, we have
∆A(x | X) = I(yx; fA | yX) = I(yx; fA, yX′ | y ¯
X) −I(yx; yX′ | y ¯
X).
Since for any x ∈S and X ⊆S, yx ⊥yX | fA, this simplifies to
I(yx; fA | yX) = I(yx; fA | y ¯
X) −I(yx; yX′ | y ¯
X).
It then follows from I(yx; yX′ | y ¯
X) ≥0 that
∆A(x | X) = I(yx; fA | yX) ≤I(yx; fA | y ¯
X) = ∆A(x | X′).

This implies that αA,S(n) ≤1 for any n and ¯κ(X | D) ≥1 for any X, D ⊆S when S ⊆A.

C.4.3
The Submodularity Ratio

Building upon the theory of maximizing non-negative monotone submodular functions (Nemhauser
et al., 1978; Krause & Golovin, 2014), Das & Kempe (2018) define the following notion of
“approximate” submodularity:

Definition C.10 (Submodularity ratio). The submodularity ratio of ψA up to cardinality n ≥1 is
κA(n)
def
=
min
D⊆x1:n
X⊆S:|X|≤n
D∩X=∅

¯κ(X | D),
(9)

where they define 0

0 ≡1. ψA is said to be κ-weakly submodular for some κ > 0 if infn∈N κA(n) ≥κ.

As a special case of Theorem 6 from Das & Kempe (2018), applying that ψA is non-negative and
monotone, we obtain the following result.
Theorem C.11 (Das & Kempe (2018)). For any n ≥1, if ITL or VTL selected x1:n, respectively,
then
ψA(x1:n) ≥(1 −e−κA(n)) max
X⊆S
|X|≤n
ψA(X).

If ψA is submodular, it is implied that κA(n) ≥1 for all n ≥1 in which case Theorem C.11 recovers
Theorem C.4.

Convergence of Marginal Gain

Our following analysis allows for changing target spaces An and sample spaces Sn (cf. Section 5),
and to this end, we redefine Γn
def
= maxx∈Sn ∆An(x | x1:n). The following theorems show that the
marginal gains of ITL and VTL converge to zero, and will serve as the main tool for establishing
Theorems 3.2 and 3.3. We will abbreviate αA,S(n) by αn.
Theorem C.12 (Convergence of Marginal Gain for ITL). Assume that Assumptions B.1 and B.2 are
satisfied. Fix any integers n1 > n0 ≥0, ∆= n1 −n0 + 1 such that for all i ∈{n0, . . . , n1 −1},
Ai+1 ⊆Ai and S

yX ⊥fAn0 | fX and the data processing inequality. The conditional independence follows from the
assumption that the observation noise is independent. Similarly, yX ⊥Dn0 | fX which implies (vii).

Keeping track of the task complexity online
In general, the task complexity αn may be larger
than one in the “directed” setting (i.e., when S ̸⊆A). However, note that αn can easily be evaluated
online by keeping track of the smallest Γi during previous rounds i.

C.6.1
Convergence outside S for ITL

We will now show convergence of marginal variance to the irreducible uncertainty for points outside
the sample space.

Our proof roughly proceeds as follows: We construct an “approximate Markov boundary” of x in
S, and show (1) that the size of this Markov boundary is independent of n, and (2) that a small
uncertainty reduction within the Markov boundary implies that the marginal variances at the Markov
boundary and(!) x are small.
Definition C.15 (Approximate Markov boundary). For any ϵ > 0, n ≥0, and x ∈X, we denote by
Bn,ϵ(x) the smallest (multi-)subset of S such that

Var[fx | Dn, yBn,ϵ(x)] ≤η2
S(x) + ϵ.
(14)

We call Bn,ϵ(x) an ϵ-approximate Markov boundary of x in S.

Equation (14) is akin to the notion of the smallest Markov blanket in S of some x ∈X (called a
Markov boundary) which is the smallest set B ⊆S such that fx ⊥fS | fB.
Lemma C.16 (Existence of an approximate Markov boundary). For any ϵ > 0, let k be the smallest
integer satisfying
γk

k ≤ϵλmin(KSS)

2|S|σ2˜σ2
.
(15)

Then, for any n ≥0 and x ∈X, there exists an ϵ-approximate Markov boundary Bn,ϵ(x) of x in S
with size at most k.

Lemma C.16 shows that for any ϵ > 0 there exists a universal constant bϵ (with respect to n and x)
such that

|Bn,ϵ(x)| ≤bϵ
∀n ≥0, x ∈X.
(16)

We defer the proof of Lemma C.16 to Appendix C.6.3 where we also provide an algorithm to compute
Bn,ϵ(x).

We remark that ¯κn(·) > 0 as is shown in Lemma C.7, and hence, the right-hand side of the inequality

Proof of Theorem 3.2 for ITL . The case where x ∈A ∩S is shown by Lemma C.14 with C = 2˜σ2.

To prove the more general result, fix any x ∈A and ϵ > 0. By Lemma C.16, there exists an
ϵ-approximate Markov boundary Bn,ϵ(x) of x in S such that |Bn,ϵ(x)| ≤bϵ. We have

Existence of an Approximate Markov Boundary

We now derive Lemma C.16 which shows the existence of an approximate Markov boundary of x
in S.
Lemma C.19. For any S ⊆S and k ≥0, there exists B ⊆S with |B| = k such that for all x′ ∈S,

Var[fx′ | yB] ≤2˜σ2 γk

Lemma C.20. Given any ϵ > 0 and B ⊆S ⊆S with |S| < ∞, such that for any x′ ∈S,

Var[fx′ | yB] ≤ϵλmin(KSS)

Then for any x ∈X,

Var[fx | yB] ≤Var[fx | fS] + ϵ.

where (i) follows from the law of total variance; (ii) uses that the conditional variance of a Gaussian
depends only on the location of observations and not on their value; and (iii) follows from fx ⊥
yB | fS since B ⊆S. It remains to bound the reducible uncertainty.

Let hx : Rd →R, fS 7→E[fx | fS] where we write d
def
= |S|. Using the formula for the GP posterior
mean, we have

hx(fS) = E[fx] + z⊤(fS −E[fS])

where z
def
= K−1
SS KSx. Because h is a linear function in fS we have for the reducible uncertainty that

VarfS[hx(fS) | yB] = z⊤Var[fS | yB]z

≤d · z⊤diag Var[fS | yB]z

all x′ ∈S; and (iii) follows from

KxSK−1
SS KSx ≤Kxx = σ2

since Kxx −KxSK−1
SS KSx ≥0.

Proof of Lemma C.16. Let B ⊆S be the set of size k generated by Lemma C.19 to satisfy
Var[fx′ | yB] ≤2˜σ2γk/k for all x′ ∈S. We have for any x ∈X,

Var[fx | Dn, yB]
(i)
≤Var[fx | yB]

(ii)
≤Var[fx | fS] + ϵ

where (i) follows from monotonicity of variance; and (ii) follows from Lemma C.20; using |S| < ∞
and the condition on k.

We remark that Lemma C.19 provides an algorithm (just “undirected” ITL!) to compute an approx-
imate Markov boundary, and the set B returned by this algorithm is a valid approximate Markov
boundary for all x ∈X. One can simply swap-in ITL with target space {x} for “undirected” ITL to
obtain tighter (but instance-dependent) bounds on the size of the approximate Markov boundary.

C.6.4
Generalization to Continuous S for Finite Dimensional RKHSs

In this subsection we generalize Theorem 3.2 to continuous sample spaces S. We will make the
following assumption:

30


---Page Break---
Assumption C.21. The RKHS of the kernel k is finite dimensional. In other words, the kernel k can
be expressed as k(x, x′) = ϕ(x)⊤ϕ(x′) for some feature map ϕ : X →Rd with d < ∞.

In
the
following,
we
will
denote
the
design
matrix
of
the
sample
space
S
by
Φ
def
= [ϕ(x) : x ∈S]⊤∈R|S|×d, and we denote by ΠΦ its orthogonal projection onto the orthogonal
complement of the span of Φ. In particular, it holds that

1. ΠΦv = 0 for all v ∈span Φ, and
2. ΠΦv = v for all v ∈(span Φ)⊥.

Especially, v ∈ker ΠΦ if and only if v ∈span Φ. This projection can be computed as follows:
Lemma C.22. It holds that
ΠΦ = I −Φ⊤(ΦΦ⊤)−1Φ.
(22)

Proof. Φ⊤(ΦΦ⊤)−1Φ is the orthogonal projection onto the span of Φ (see, e.g., Strang, 2016, page
211).

Lemma C.23. Under Assumption C.21, the irreducible uncertainty η2
S(x) of x ∈X is

η2
S(x) = ∥ϕ(x)∥2
ΠΦ
(23)

where ∥v∥A =
√

v⊤Av denotes the Mahalanobis distance.

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the formula for the conditional variance of multivariate
Gaussians (cf. Appendix B.2), applied to the linear kernel.

Lemmas C.22 and C.23 imply that η2
S(x∥) = 0 for all x∥∈X with ϕ(x∥) ∈span Φ. That
is, the irreducible uncertainty is zero for points in the span of the sample space. In contrast, for
points x⊥with ϕ(x⊥) ∈(span Φ)⊥, the irreducible uncertainty equals the initial uncertainty:
η2
S(x⊥) = σ2
0(x⊥). The irreducible uncertainty of any other point x can be computed by simple
decomposition of ϕ(x) into parallel and orthogonal components.

Assuming that Assumption C.21 holds and given any (non-finite) S ⊆X, there exists a basis
ΩS ⊆X in the space of embeddings ϕ(·) such that span S = span ΩS and |ΩS| ≤d. The
generalized existence of an approximate Markov boundary for continuous domains can then be
shown analogously to Lemma C.16:
Lemma C.24 (Existence of an approximate Markov boundary for a continuous domain). Let S be
any (continuous) subset of X and let Assumption C.21 hold with d < ∞. Further, for any ϵ > 0, let
k be the smallest integer satisfying
γk

k ≤ϵλmin(KΩSΩS)

2dσ2˜σ2
.
(24)

Then, for any n ≥0 and x ∈X, there exists an ϵ-approximate Markov boundary Bn,ϵ(x) of x in S
with size at most k.

Proof sketch. The proof follows analogously to Lemma C.16 by conditioning on the finite set ΩS as
opposed to S.

C.7
Proof of Theorem 3.3

We first formalize the assumptions of Theorem 3.3:
Assumption C.25 (Regularity of f ⋆). We assume that f ⋆is in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
Hk(X) associated with a kernel k and has bounded norm, that is, ∥f ⋆∥k ≤B for some finite B ∈R.
Assumption C.26 (Sub-Gaussian noise). We further assume that each εn from the noise sequence
{εn}∞
n=1 is conditionally zero-mean ρ(xn)-sub-Gaussian with known constants ρ(x) > 0 for all
x ∈X. Concretely,

∀n ≥1, λ ∈R :
E

eλϵn  Dn−1

≤exp
λ2ρ2(xn)

2



where Dn−1 corresponds to the σ-algebra generated by the random variables {xi, ϵi}n−1
i=1 and xn.

31


---Page Break---
We make use of the following foundational result, showing that under the above two assumptions the
(misspecified) Gaussian process model from Section 3.1 is an all-time well-calibrated model of f ⋆:
Lemma C.27 (Well-calibrated confidence intervals; Abbasi-Yadkori (2013); Chowdhury & Gopalan
(2017)). Pick δ ∈(0, 1) and let Assumptions C.25 and C.26 hold. Let

βn(δ) = ∥f ⋆∥k + ρ
p

2(γn + 1 + log(1/δ))

where ρ = maxx∈X ρ(x).10 Then, for all x ∈X and n ≥0 jointly with probability at least 1 −δ,

|f ⋆(x) −µn(x)| ≤βn(δ) · σn(x)

where µn(x) and σ2
n(x) are mean and variance (as defined in Appendix B.2) of the GP posterior of
f(x) conditional on the observations Dn, pretending that εi is Gaussian with variance ρ2(xi).

The proof of Theorem 3.3 is a straightforward application of Lemma C.27 and Theorem 3.2:

Proof of Theorem 3.3. By Theorem 3.2, we have that for all x ∈A,

σn(x) ≤
q

η2
S(x) + ν2
A,S(n) ≤ηS(x) + νA,S(n).

The result then follows by application of Lemma C.27.

C.8
Proof of Theorem 5.1

In this section, we derive our main result on Safe BO. In Appendix C.8.1, we give the definition of
the reachable safe set R and derive the conditions under which convergence to the reachable safe set
is guaranteed. Then, in Appendix C.8.2, we prove Theorem 5.1.

Notation
In the agnostic setting from Section 3.2 (i.e., under Assumptions C.25 and C.26),
Lemma C.27 provides us with the following (1 −δ)-confidence intervals (CIs)

Cn(x)
def
= Cn−1(x) ∩[µn(x) ± βn(δ) · σn(x)]
(25)

where
C−1(x) = R.
We
write
un(x)
def
= max Cn(x),
ln(x)
def
= min Cn(x),
and
wn(x)
def
= un(x) −ln(x) for its upper bound, lower bound, and width, respectively.

We learn separate statistical models f and {g1, . . . , gq} for the ground truth objective f ⋆and
ground truth constraints {g⋆
1, . . . , g⋆
q}. We write I
def
= {f, 1, . . . , q} and collect the constraints in
Is
def
= {1, . . . , q}.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the confidence intervals include
the ground truths with probability at least 1 −δ jointly for all i ∈I.11 For i ∈I, denote by
un,i, ln,i, wn,i, ηi, βn,i the respective quantities. In the following, we do not explicitly denote the
dependence of βn on δ.

To improve clarity, we will refer to the set of potential maximizers defined in Equation (5) as Mn
and denote by An an arbitrary target space.

We point out the following corollary:
Corollary C.28 (Safety). With high probability, jointly for any n ≥0 and any i ∈Is,

∀x ∈Sn : g⋆
i (x) ≥0.
(26)

C.8.1
Convergence to Reachable Safe Set

Definition C.29 (Reachable safe set). Given any pessimistic safe set S ⊆X and any ϵ ≥0 and
β ≥0, we define the reachable safe set up to (ϵ, β)-slack and its closure as

Rϵ,β(S)
def
= S ∪{x ∈X \ S |
g⋆
i (x) −β(ηi(x; S) + ϵ) ≥0 for all i ∈Is}
¯Rϵ,β(S)
def
= lim
n→∞(Rϵ,β)n(S)

where (Rϵ,β)n denotes the n-th composition of Rϵ,β with itself.

10βn(δ) can be tightened adaptively (Emmenegger et al., 2023).
11This can be achieved by taking a union bound and rescaling δ.

32


---Page Break---
Remark C.30. Convergence of the safe set to the closure of the reachability operator can only be
guaranteed for finite safe sets (|S⋆| < ∞). The following proofs readily generalize to continuous
domains by considering convergence within the k-th composition of the reachability operator with
itself for some k < ∞. In this case the sample complexity grows with k rather than |S⋆|. The only
required modification is to lift the assumption of Theorem C.12 that information is gained only while
safe sets remain constant (i.e., Si+1 = Si for all i). This assumption is straightforward to lift since
for any n ≥0 and T ≥1,

max
x∈Sn ∆A(x | x1:n+T ) ≤1

using submodularity for the first inequality and the monotonicity of the safe set for the second
inequality. In particular, this shows that one continues learning about points in the original safe set —
even as the safe set grows.

We denote by S0 the initial pessimistic safe set induced by the (prior) statistical model g (cf. Section 5)
and write ¯Rϵ,β
def
= ¯Rϵ,β(S0).
Lemma C.31 (Properties of the reachable safe set). For all S, S′ ⊆X, ϵ ≥0, and β ≥0:

(i) S′ ⊆S =⇒Rϵ,β(S′) ⊆Rϵ,β(S),

(ii) Rϵ,β(S) ⊆S =⇒
¯Rϵ,β(S) ⊆S, and

(iii) R0,0(∅) = ¯R0,0 = S⋆.

Proof (adapted from lemma 7.1 of Berkenkamp et al. (2021)).

1. Let x ∈Rϵ,β(S′).
If x ∈S then x ∈Rϵ,β(S), so let x ̸∈S.
Then, by defi-
nition, for all i ∈Is, f ⋆
i (x) −βηi(x; S′) −ϵ ≥0.
By the monotonicity of variance,
ηi(x; S′) ≥ηi(x; S) for all i ∈I, and hence f ⋆
i (x) −βηi(x; S) −ϵ ≥0 for all i ∈Is. It
follows that x ∈Rϵ,β(S).

2. By the monotonicity of variance, ηi(x; Rϵ,β(S)) ≥ηi(x; S) for all x ∈X and i ∈I. Thus,
by definition of the safe region, we have that Rϵ,β(Rϵ,β(S)) ⊆S. The result follows by
taking the limit.

3. The result follows directly from the definition of the true safe set S⋆(cf. Equation (4)).

Clearly, we cannot expand the safe set beyond ¯R0,0. The following is our main intermediate result,
showing that either we expand the safe set at some point or the uncertainty converges to the irreducible
uncertainty.
Lemma C.32. Given any n0 ≥0, ϵ > 0, let n′ be the smallest integer such that νn′,˜ϵ2 ≤˜ϵ
where ˜ϵ = ϵ/2. Let βn0+n′ = maxi∈Is βn0+n′,i. Assume that the sequence of target spaces is
monotonically decreasing, i.e., An+1 ⊆An. Then, we have with high probability (at least) one of

∀x ∈An0+n′, ∀i ∈I :

wn0+n′,i(x) ≤βn0+n′[ηi(x; Sn0+n′) + ϵ]

and
An0+n′ ∩Rϵ,βn0+n′(Sn0+n′) ⊆Sn0+n′


or |Sn0+n′+1| > |Sn0|.

Proof. Suppose that |Sn0+n′+1| = |Sn0|. Then, by Theorem 3.3 (using that the sequence of target
spaces is monotonically decreasing), for any x ∈An0+n′ and i ∈I,

wn0+n′,i(x) ≤βn0+n′[ηi(x; Sn0+n′) + ϵ].

As Sn0+n′+1 = Sn0+n′ we have for all x ∈An0+n′ \ Sn0+n′ and i ∈Is, with high probability that

0 > ln0+n′,i(x) ≥g⋆
i (x) −wn0+n′,i(x)
≥g⋆
i (x) −βn0+n′[ηi(x; Sn0+n′) + ϵ].

It follows that An0+n′ ∩Rϵ,βn0+n′(Sn0+n′) ⊆Sn0+n′.

---Page Break---
To gather more intuition about the above lemma, consider the target space

En
def
= bSn \ Sn.
(27)

We call En the potential expanders since it contains all points which might be safe, but are not yet
known to be safe. Under this target space, the above lemma simplifies slightly:

Lemma C.33. For any n ≥0 and ϵ, β ≥0, if En ⊆An then with high probability,

Sn ∪(An ∩Rϵ,β(Sn)) = Rϵ,β(Sn).

Proof. With high probability, Rϵ,β(Sn) ⊆bSn = Sn ∪En. The lemma is a direct consequence.

The above lemmas can be combined to yield our main result of this subsection, establishing the
convergence of ITL to the reachable safe set.

Theorem C.34 (Convergence to reachable safe set). For any ϵ > 0, let n′ be the smallest integer
satisfying the condition of Lemma C.32, and define n⋆def
= (|S⋆| + 1)n′. Let ¯βn⋆≥βn,i for all
n ≤n⋆, i ∈Is. Assume that the sequence of target spaces is monotonically decreasing, i.e.,
An+1 ⊆An. Then, the following inequalities hold jointly with probability at least 1 −δ:

(i) ∀n ≥0, ∀i ∈Is : g⋆
i (xn) ≥0,

safety

(ii) An⋆∩¯Rϵ, ¯βn⋆⊆Sn⋆⊆¯R0,0 = S⋆,

convergence to safe region

(iii) ∀x ∈An⋆, ∀i ∈I : wn⋆,i(x) ≤¯βn⋆ηi(x; ¯Rϵ, ¯βn⋆) + ϵ,

convergence of width

(iv) ∀x ∈¯Rϵ, ¯βn⋆, ∀i ∈I : ηi(x; ¯Rϵ, ¯βn⋆) = 0.

convergence of width within safe region

Proof. (i) is a direct consequence of Corollary C.28. Sn⋆⊆S⋆follows directly from the pessimistic
safe set Sn⋆from (ii) being a subset of the true safe set S⋆. (iv) follows directly from the definition
of irreducible uncertainty. Thus, it remains to establish An⋆∩¯Rϵ, ¯βn⋆⊆Sn⋆and (iii).

Recall that with high probability |Sn| ∈[0, |S⋆|] for all n ≥0. Thus, the size of the pessimistic safe
set can increase at most |S⋆| many times. By Lemma C.32, using the assumption on n′, the size of
the pessimistic safe set increases at least once every n′ iterations, or else:

∀x ∈An0+n′, ∀i ∈I : wn0+n′,i(x) ≤βn0+n′[ηi(x; Sn0+n′) + ϵ]
and
An0+n′ ∩Rϵ,βn0+n′(Sn0+n′) ⊆Sn0+n′.
(28)

Because the safe set can expand at most |S⋆| many times, Equation (28) occurs eventually for some
n0 ≤|S⋆|n′. In this case, since ¯βn⋆≥βn0+n′ and An⋆⊆An0+n′ (as n0 + n′ ≤n⋆) we have that

An⋆∩Rϵ, ¯βn⋆(Sn0+n′) ⊆An0+n′ ∩Rϵ,βn0+n′(Sn0+n′)

⊆Sn0+n′.

By Lemma C.31 (ii), this implies

An⋆∩¯Rϵ, ¯βn⋆⊆Sn0+n′ ⊆Sn⋆.

We emphasize that Theorem C.34 holds for arbitrary target spaces An. If additionally, En ⊆An
for all n ≥0 then by Lemma C.33, Theorem C.34 (ii) strengthens to ¯Rϵ, ¯βn⋆⊆Sn⋆. Intuitively,
En ⊆An ensures that one aims to expand the safe set in all directions. Conversely, if En ̸⊆An then
one aims only to expand the safe set in the direction of An (or not at all if An ⊆Sn).

“Free” convergence guarantees in many applications
Theorem C.34 can be specialized to yield
convergence guarantees in various settings by choosing an appropriate target space An. Straightfor-
ward application of Theorem C.34 (informally) requires that the sequence of target spaces is mono-
tonically decreasing (i.e., An+1 ⊆An), and that each target space An is an “over-approximation” of
the actual set of targeted points (such as the set of optimas in the Bayesian optimization setting). We
discuss two such applications in the following.

1. Pure expansion: For example, for the target space En, Theorem C.34 bounds the convergence
of the safe set to the reachable safe set. In this case, the transductive active learning problem
corresponds to the “pure expansion” setting, also addressed by the ISE baseline discussed
in Section 5. The ISE baseline, however, does not establish convergence guarantees of the
kind of Theorem C.34. Note that En satisfies the (informal) requirements laid out previously,
since it is monotonically decreasing by definition, and with high probability, any point
x ∈S⋆that is not in Sn is contained within En.
2. Level set estimation: Given any τ ∈R, we denote the (safe) τ-level set of f ⋆by
Lτ def
= {x ∈S⋆| f ⋆(x) = τ}. We define the potential level set as

Lτ
n
def
= {x ∈bSn | lf
n(x) ≤τ ≤uf
n(x)}.
(29)

That is, Lτ
n is the subset of the optimistic safe set bSn where the τ-level set of f ⋆may
be located. Analogously to the potential expanders, it is straightforward to show that Lτ
n
over-approximates the true τ-level set and is monotonically decreasing.

We remark that our guarantees from this section also apply to the standard (“unsafe”) setting where
S⋆= S0 = X.

C.8.2
Convergence to Safe Optimum

In this section, we specialize Theorem C.34 for the case that the target space contains the potential
maximizers Mn (cf. Equation (5)). It is straightforward to see that the sequence Mn is monotonically
decreasing (i.e., Mn+1 ⊆Mn). The following lemma shows that the potential maximizers over-
approximate the set of safe maxima X ∗def
= arg maxx∈S⋆f ⋆(x).
Lemma C.35 (Potential maximizers over-approximate safe maxima). For all n ≥0 and with
probability at least 1 −δ,

(i) x ∈X ∗implies x ∈Mn and

(ii) x ̸∈Mn implies x ̸∈X ∗.

Proof. If x ̸∈Mn then

un,f(x) < max
x′∈Sn
ln,f(x′) ≤max
x′∈S⋆ln,f(x′)

where we used Sn ⊆S⋆with high probability, which directly implies with high probability that
x ̸∈X ∗.

For the other direction, if x ∈X ∗then

un,f(x) ≥max
x′∈S⋆ln,f(x′) ≥max
x′∈Sn
ln,f(x′)

with high probability.

We denote the set of optimal actions which are safe up to (ϵ, β)-slack by

X ∗
ϵ,β
def
= arg max
x∈¯
Rϵ,β
f ⋆(x),

and by f ∗
ϵ,β the maximum value attained by f ⋆at any of the points in X ∗
ϵ,β. The regret can be
expressed as

rn( ¯Rϵ,β) = f ∗
ϵ,β −f ⋆(bxn)

The following theorem formalizes Theorem 5.1 and establishes convergence to the safe optimum.

where (i) follows from the definition of bxn; and (ii) follows from Theorem C.34 and noting that
x∗∈Mn⋆∩¯Rϵ, ¯βn⋆.

We have shown that f ⋆(bxn⋆) ≥f ∗
ϵ, ¯βn⋆−ϵ, which implies rn⋆( ¯Rϵ, ¯βn⋆) ≤ϵ. Since the upper- and
lower-confidence bounds are monotonically decreasing / increasing, respectively, we have that for all

Interpretations & Approximations of Principle (†)

We give a brief overview of interpretations and approximations of ITL, as well as alternative decision
rules adhering to the fundamental principle (†).

The discussed interpretations of (†) differ mainly in how they quantify the “uncertainty” about A. In
the GP setting, this “uncertainty” is captured by the covariance matrix Σ of fA, and we consider two
main ways of “scalarizing” Σ:

1. the total (marginal) variance tr Σ, and
2. the “generalized variance” |Σ|.

The generalized variance — which was originally suggested by Wilks (1932) as a generalization
of variance to multiple dimensions — takes into account correlations. In contrast, the total variance
discards all correlations between points in A.

All discussed decision rules following principle (†) (i.e., ITL, VTL, MM-ITL) differ only in their
weighting of the points in A, and they coincide when |A| = 1.

D.1
Interpretations of ITL

We briefly discuss three interpretations of ITL.

Minimizing generalized variance
In the GP setting, ITL can be equivalently characterized as
minimizing generalized posterior variance:

xn = arg max
x∈S
I(fA; yx | Dn)

= arg max
x∈S

1
2 log

|Var[fA | Dn−1]|
|Var[fA | Dn−1, yx]|



= arg min
x∈S
|Var[fA | Dn−1, yx]| .
(32)

Maximizing relevance and minimizing redundancy
An alternative interpretation of ITL is

I(fA; yx | Dn) = I(fA; yx)
|
{z
}
relevance

−I(fA; yx; Dn)
|
{z
}
redundancy

(33)

where I(fA; yx; Dn) = I(fA; yx) −I(fA; yx | Dn) denotes the multivariate information gain
(cf. Appendix B). In this way, ITL can be seen as maximizing observation relevance while
minimizing observation redundancy. This interpretation is common in the literature on feature
selection (Peng et al., 2005; Vergara & Estévez, 2014; Beraha et al., 2019).

Steepest descent in measure spaces
ITL can be seen as performing steepest descent in the space
of probability measures over fA, with the KL divergence as metric:

I(fA; yx | Dn) = Eyx[KL(p(fA | Dn, yx)∥p(fA | Dn))].

That is, ITL finds the observation yielding the “largest update” to the current density.

D.2
Interpretations of VTL

Quantifying the uncertainty about fA by the marginal variance of points in A rather than entropy (or
generalized variance), the principle (†) leads to VTL. Note that if |A| = 1, then VTL is equivalent
to ITL. Unlike the similar, but more technical, TRUVAR algorithm proposed by Bogunovic et al.
(2016), VTL does not require truncated variances, and hence, VTL can be applied to constrained
settings (where A ̸⊆S) as well.

37


---Page Break---
Relationship to ITL
Note that the ITL criterion in the GP setting can be expressed as

xn = arg min
x∈S
tr log Var[fA | Dn−1, yx]
(34)

where for a positive semi-definite matrix A with spectral decomposition A = V ΛV ⊤we write
log A = V log ΛV ⊤for the logarithmic matrix function. To derive Equation (34) we use that
log |A| = P

i log λi(A) = tr log A. Hence, ITL and VTL are identical up to a different weighting
of the eigenvalues of the posterior covariance matrix.

Minimizing a bound to the approximation error
Chowdhury & Gopalan (2017) (page 19) bound
the approximation error |f ⋆(x) −µn(x)| by

|kt(x)⊤(Kt + P t)−1ε1:t|
|
{z
}
variance

+ |f ⋆(x) −kt(x)⊤(Kt + P t)−1f 1:t|
|
{z
}
bias

where kt(x)
def
= Kxx1:t, Kt
def
= Kx1:tx1:t, and P t
def
= Px1:t. Similar to a standard bias-variance
decomposition, the first term measures variance and the second term measures bias. Following
Lemma C.27, VTL can be seen as greedily minimizing this bound to the approximation error (i.e.,
both bias and variance).

Maximizing correlation to prediction targets weighted by their variance
It can be shown (see
the proof below) that the VTL decision rule is equivalent to

xn = arg max
x∈S

X

x′∈A
Var[fx′ | Dn−1] · Cor[fx′, yx | Dn−1]2.
(35)

That is, VTL maximizes the squared correlation between the next observation and the prediction
targets, weighted by their variance. Intuitively, prediction targets are weighted by their variance
since more can be learned about a prediction target with higher variance. This is precisely what
leads to the “diverse” sample selection, and is akin to “uncertainty sampling” among the prediction
targets and then selecting the observation which is most correlated with the selected prediction target.

Proof. Starting with the VTL objective, we have

arg min
x∈S

X

x′∈A
Var[fx′ | Dn, yx] = arg min
x∈S

X

x′∈A

 

Var[fx′ | Dn] −Cov[fx′, yx | Dn]2

Var[yx | Dn]

!

= arg max
x∈S

X

x′∈A

Var[fx′ | Dn] · Cov[fx′, yx | Dn]2

Var[fx′ | Dn] · Var[yx | Dn]
+ const

= arg max
x∈S

X

x′∈A
Var[fx′ | Dn] · Cor[fx′, yx | Dn]2 + const.

D.3
Mean Marginal ITL

MacKay (1992) previously proposed “mean-marginal” ITL (MM-ITL) in the setting where S = X,
which selects

xn = arg max
x∈S

X

x′∈A
I(fx′; yx | Dn−1)
(36)

and which simplifies in the GP setting to

xn = arg max
x∈S

1
2

X

x′∈A
log

Var[fx′ | Dn−1]
Var[fx′ | Dn−1, yx]



= arg min
x∈S

X

x′∈A
log Var[fx′ | Dn−1, yx]

= arg min
x∈S
tr log diag Var[fA | Dn−1, yx].
(37)

38


---Page Break---
Analogously to the derivation of Equation (34), this can also be expressed as

xn = arg min
x∈S
|diag Var[fA | Dn−1, yx]| .
(38)

Effectively, MM-ITL ignores the mutual interaction between points in A. As can be seen from
Equation (37) and as is also mentioned by MacKay (1992), MM-ITL is equivalent to VTL up to a
different weighting of the points in A: instead of minimizing the average posterior variance (as in
VTL), MM-ITL minimizes the average posterior log-variance. Under the lens of principle (†), this
can be seen as minimizing the average marginal entropy of predictions within the target space:

xn = arg min
x∈S

X

x′∈A
H[fx′ | Dn−1, yx] .

We remark that MM-ITL is a special case of EPIG (Bickford Smith et al., 2023, Appendix E.2).

Not a generalization of uncertainty sampling
Unlike ITL, MM-ITL is not a generalization of
uncertainty sampling. The reason is precisely that MM-ITL ignores the mutual interaction between
points in A. Consider the example where X = S = A = {1, . . . , 10} where f1:9 are highly correlated
while f10 is mostly independent of the other points. Visually, imagine a smooth function (i.e., under a
Gaussian kernel) with points 1 through 9 close to each other and point 10 far away. Further, suppose
that point 10 has a slightly larger marginal variance than the others. Then, MM-ITL would select
one of the points 1 : 9 since this leads to the largest reduction in the marginal (log-)variances (i.e.,
to a small posterior “uncertainty”).13 In contrast, ITL selects the point with the largest prior marginal
variance (cf. Appendix C.1), point 10, since this leads to the largest reduction in entropy.14

Similarity to VTL
Observe that the following decision rule is equivalent to VTL:

xn = arg max
x∈S
tr Var[fA | Dn−1] −tr Var[fA | Dn−1, yx].

By Lemma C.38, for any x ∈S, this objective value can be tightly lower- and upper-bounded (up
to constant-factors) by
X

x′∈A


Var[fx′ | Dn−1]

(39)

where (i) is detailed in example 8.5.1 of Cover (1999). Thus, VTL and MM-ITL are closely related.

Experiments
In our experiments with Gaussian processes from Figures 2 and 6, we observe that
MM-ITL performs similarly to VTL and CTL.

Convergence of uncertainty
We derive a convergence guarantee for MM-ITL which is analogous
to the guarantees for ITL from Theorem C.12 and for VTL from Theorem C.13. We will assume
for simplicity that Γn is monotonically decreasing in n (i.e., αn ≤1).
Theorem D.1 (Convergence of uncertainty reduction of MM-ITL). Assume that Assumptions B.1
and B.2 are satisfied. Then for any n ≥1, if Γ0 ≥· · · ≥Γn−1 and the sequence {xi}n
i=1 is generated
by MM-ITL, then

Γn−1 ≤1

n

X

x′∈A
γn({x′}; S).
(40)

Proof. We have

Γn−1 = 1

n

n−1
X

i=0
Γn−1

13This is because the observation reduces uncertainty not just about the observed point itself.
14Because points f1:9 are highly correlated, H[f1:9] is already “small”.

where (i) follows by assumption; (ii) follows from the MM-ITL decision rule; (iii) uses that the
posterior variance of Gaussians is independent of the realization and only depends on the location
of observations; and (iv) uses the chain rule of mutual information. The remainder of the proof is
analogous to the proof of Theorem C.12 (cf. Appendix C.5).

Noting that

I(fx′; yx | Dn−1) ≤
X

x′∈A
I(fx′; yx | Dn−1)

for any n ≥1, x ∈X, and x′ ∈A, Theorem 3.2 can be readily rederived for MM-ITL (cf.
Lemmas C.14 and C.18). Hence, the posterior marginal variances of MM-ITL can be bounded
uniformly in terms of Γn analogously to ITL.

D.4
Correlation-based Transductive Learning

We will briefly look at the CTL (Correlation-based TL) decision rule

xn = arg max
x∈S

X

x′∈A
Cor[fx, fx′ | Dn−1]
(41)

which permits no interpretation under principle (†). However, if all correlations are non-negative
(such as for the standard Gaussian and Matérn kernels), CTL is closely related to ITL, VTL, and
MM-ITL (cf. Equations (35) and (39)). In this case, if |A| = 1, then all decision rules coincide.

If, on the other hand, correlations may be negative then there is a crucial difference between CTL and
the decision rules motivated from principle (†). Namely, decision rules following (†) exhibit a prefer-
ence for points with high absolute correlation to prediction targets as opposed to CTL which prefers
points with high positive correlation. This stems from the intuitive fact that points with a strong
negative correlation are equally informative as points with a strong positive correlation. Nevertheless,
we observe in our experiments that (even for a linear kernel which does not ensure non-negative cor-
relations) points selected by ITL and VTL are typically positively correlated with prediction targets.

D.5
Summary

We have seen that ITL, VTL, and MM-ITL can be seen as different interpretations of the
same fundamental principle (†), with the approximations CTL. If |A| = 1 and correlations are
non-negative, then all four decision rules are equivalent. CTL prefers points with high positive

40


---Page Break---
correlation whereas the other decision rules prefer points with high absolute correlation. ITL is the
only decision rule that takes into account the mutual dependence between points in A, and VTL
and MM-ITL differ only in their weighting of the posterior marginal variances of points in A.

E
Stochastic Target Spaces

When the target space A is large, it may be computationally infeasible to compute the exact objective.
A natural approach to address this issue is to approximate the target space by a smaller set of size K.

Discretizing the target space
One possibility is to discretize the target space A. Compact target
spaces can be addressed, e.g., via discretization arguments which are common in the Bayesian
optimization literature (see, e.g., appendix C.1 of Srinivas et al. (2009)). That is, if the target
space can be covered approximately using a finite (possibly large) set of points, the guarantees of
Theorem 3.2 extend directly. This, however, can be impractical when the required size of discretization
for sufficiently small approximation error is large. In the following, we briefly discuss a natural
alternative approach based on sampling points from A.

Target distributions
Let A ⊆X be a (possibly continuous) target space, and let PA be a probability
distribution supported on A. In iteration n, a subset An of K points is sampled independently from A
according to the distribution PA and the objective is computed on this subset. Formally, this amounts
to a single-sample Monte Carlo approximation of

xn ∈arg max
x∈S
EA
iid
∼PA[I(fA; yx | Dn−1)].
(42)

The convergence guarantees from Appendix C can be generalized to the setting of stochastic target
spaces by estimating how often points “near” a specified prediction target x ∈A are sampled.
Definition E.1 (γ-ball at x). Given x ∈A and any γ ≥0, we call the set

Bγ(x)
def
= {x′ ∈X | ∥x −x′∥≤γ}

the γ-ball at x. Further, we call PA(Bγ(x)) the weight of that ball.
Proposition E.2 (sketch). Given any n ≥1, K ≥1, γ > 0, and x ∈A, suppose that Bγ(x) has
weight p > 0. Assume that the ITL objective is LI-Lipschitz continuous. Then, with probability at
least 1 −exp(−(1 −p)n/(8K)),

σ2
n(x) ≲η2
S(x) + CLIγ γk(n)
p

k(n)

where k(n)
def
= Kpn/2.

Proof sketch. Let Yi ∼Binom(K, p) denote the random variable counting the number of occurrences
of a point from Bγ(x) in Ai. Moreover, we write Xi
def
= 1{Bγ(x) ∩Ai ̸= ∅}. Note that

ν
def
= EXi = P(Bγ(x) ∩Ai ̸= ∅) = 1 −P(Yi = 0) = 1 −(1 −p)K ≈Kp

where the approximation stems from a first-order truncation of the Bernoulli series.
Let
X
def
= Pn
i=1 Xi with EX = nν ≈Kpn.

Using
the
assumed
Lipschitz-continuity
of
the
objective,
we
know
that
I(fA′; yx | Dn−1) ≤LIγI(fA; yx | Dn−1) where A′ def
= (A \ {xγ}) ∪{x} and xγ is the point
from the γ-ball at x. The bound then follows analogously to Theorem 3.2.

Finally, by Chernoff’s bound, at least Kpn/2 iterations contain a point from Bγ(x) with probability
at least 1 −exp(−Kpn/8).

This strategy can also be used to generalize the VTL, CTL, and MM-ITL objectives to stochastic
target spaces.

Closed-form Decision Rules

Let |S| = m and |A| = k. Then, the forward method has complexity O
 
m · k3
. For the backward
method, observe that the variances are scalar and the covariance matrix Var[fA | Dn] only has to
be inverted once for all points x. Thus, the backward method has complexity O
 
k3 + m

.

When the size m of S is relatively small (and hence, all points in S can be considered during each
iteration of the algorithm), GP inference corresponds simply to computing conditional distributions
of a multivariate Gaussian. The performance can therefore be improved by keeping track of the full
posterior distribution over fS of size O
 
m2
and conditioning on the latest observation during each
iteration of the algorithm. In this case, after each observation the posterior can be updated at a cost
of O
 
m2
which does not grow with the time n, unlike classical GP inference.

Overall, when m is small, the computational complexity of ITL is O
 
k3 + m2
. When m is large
(or possibly infinite) and a subset of ˜m points is considered in a given iteration, the computational
complexity of ITL is O
 
k3 + ˜m · n3
, neglecting the complexity of selecting the ˜m candidate points.
In the latter case, the computational cost of ITL is dominated by the cost of GP inference.

Khanna et al. (2017) discuss distributed and stochastic approximations of greedy algorithms to
(weakly) submodular problems that are also applicable to ITL.

Additional GP Experiments & Details

We use homoscedastic Gaussian noise with standard deviation ρ = 0.1 and a discretization of
X = [−3, 3]2 of size 2 500. Uncertainty bands correspond to one standard error over 10 random seeds.

Additional experiments
Figure 6 includes the following additional experiments:

1. Extrapolation Setting (A ∩S = ∅): Right experiment from Figure 2 under the Gaussian
kernel. ITL has a similar advantage as in the setting shown in Figure 3.
2. Heteroscedastic Noise: Left experiment from Figure 2 under the Gaussian kernel with

.

If observation noise is heteroscedastic, in considering posterior rather than prior uncertainty,
ITL avoids points with high aleatoric uncertainty, which accelerates learning.

Alternative Settings for Active Fine-Tuning

In our main experiments, we consider the setting A∩S = ∅, i.e., the prediction targets cannot be used
for fine-tuning since their labels are not known. This setting is particularly relevant for practical ap-
plications where the model is fine-tuned dynamically at test time to each prediction target (or a small
set of prediction target). Put differently, in this “transductive” setting, extrapolation to new prediction
targets happens at test-time with knowledge of the prediction target(s). This is in contrast to a more
traditional “inductive” setting, where extrapolation happens at train-time without knowledge of the
concrete prediction targets, but under the assumption of samples from (or knowledge of) the target dis-
tribution. In the following, we briefly survey two settings motivated from an “inductive” perspective.

I.1
Prediction Targets are Contained in Sample Space: A ⊆S

If labels can be obtained cheaply, one can also fine-tune on the prediction targets directly, i.e., A ⊆S.
Note, however, that the set A is still assumed to be small (e.g., |A| = 100 in the CIFAR-100 exper-
iment). We perform an experiment in this setting and report the results in Figure 7. The experiment
shows that — similarly to the GP experiment from Figure 2 — there can be additional value in
fine-tuning the model on relevant data selected from S beyond simply fine-tuning the model on A.

all of A. This experiment shows that there is additional value in fine-tuning the model on relevant data
from S beyond simply fine-tuning the model on A. The baselines are summarized in Appendix J.5

I.2
Active Domain Adaptation

Active DA (Rai et al., 2010; Saha et al., 2011; Berlind & Urner, 2015) studies the problem of selecting
the most informative samples from a (large) target domain A, given a model trained on a source
domain S. This problem can be cast as an instance of transductive active learning with target space A
and sample space S′ = S ∪A where the model is already conditioned on all of S. This is slightly dif-
ferent from the setting considered in Section 4 where A is small and not necessarily part of the sample
space. We hypothesize that ITL behaves similarly to recent work on active DA (Su et al., 2020; Prabhu
et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2021): querying informative and diverse samples from A that are dissimilar
to S. Evaluating ITL and VTL empirically in this setting is a promising direction for future work.

Experiment Details

We evaluate the accuracy with respect to PA using a Monte Carlo approximation with out-of-sample
data:

accuracy(bθ) ≈E(x,y)∼PA1{y = arg max
i
fi(x; bθ)}.

We provide an overview of the hyperparameters used in our NN experiments in Table 1. The effect
of noise standard deviation ρ is small for all tested ρ ∈[1, 100] (cf. ablation study in Table 2).15
M denotes the size of the sample A ∼PA. In each iteration, we select the target space A ←A′ as
a random subset of m points from A.16 We provide an ablation over m in Appendix J.6.

During each iteration, we select the batch B according to the decision rule from a random sample
from PS of size k.17

Since we train the MNIST model from scratch, we train from random initialization until convergence
on oracle validation accuracy.18 We do this to stabilize the learning curves, and provide the least
biased (due to the training algorithm) results. For CIFAR-100, we train for 5 epochs (starting from
the previous iterations’ model) which we found to be sufficient to obtain good performance.

We use the ADAM optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014). In our CIFAR-100 experiments, we use a
pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 (Tan & Le, 2019), and fine-tune the final and penultimate layers. We
freeze earlier layers to prevent overfitting to the “few-shot” training data.

To prevent numerical inaccuracies when computing the ITL objective, we optimize

I(yA; yx | Dn−1) = 1

2 log

Var[yx | Dn−1]
Var[yx | yA, Dn−1]


(44)

instead of Equation (43), which amounts to adding ρ2 to the diagonal of the covariance matrix before
inversion. This appears to improve numerical stability, especially when using gradient embeddings.19

15We use a larger noise standard deviation ρ in CIFAR-100 to stabilize the numerics of batch selection via
conditional embeddings (cf. Table 2).
16This appears to improve the training, likely because it prevents overfitting to peculiarities in the finite
sample A (cf. Figure 16).
17In large-scale problems, the work of Coleman et al. (2022) suggests to use an (approximate) nearest neighbor
search to select the (large) candidate set rather than sampling u.a.r. from PS. This can be a viable alternative to
simply increasing k and suggests future work.
18That is, to stop training as soon as accuracy on a validation set from PA decreases in an epoch.
19In our experiments, we observe that the effect of various choices of ρ on this slight adaptation of the ITL
decision rule has negligible impact on performance. The more prominent effect of ρ appears to arise from the
batch selection via conditional embeddings (cf. Table 2).

In our experiments, we use last-layer neural tangent embeddings20 and Σ = I to evaluate ITL
and VTL, and select inputs for labeling and training f. Notably, we use this linear Gaussian
approximation of f only to guide the active data selection and not for inference.

J.2
Embeddings and Kernels

Using a neural network to parameterize f, we evaluate the canonical approximations of f by a
stochastic process in the following.

An embedding ϕ(x) is a latent representation of an input x. Collecting the embeddings as rows
in the design matrix Φ of a set of inputs X, one can approximate the network by the linear
function fX = Φβ with weights β. Approximating the weights by β ∼N(µ, Σ) implies that
fX ∼N(Φµ, ΦΣΦ⊤). The covariance matrix KXX = ΦΣΦ⊤can be succinctly represented in
terms of its associated kernel k(x, x′) = ϕ(x)⊤Σϕ(x′). Here,

• ϕ(x) is the latent representation of x, and
• Σ captures the dependencies in the latent space.

While any choice of embedding ϕ is possible, the following are common choices:

1. Last-Layer: A common choice for ϕ(x) is the representation of x from the penultimate
layer of the neural network (Holzmüller et al., 2023). Interpreting the early layers as a
feature encoder, this uses the low-dimensional feature map akin to random feature methods
(Rahimi & Recht, 2007).
2. Output Gradients (eNTK): Another common choice is ϕ(x) = ∇θ f(x; θ) where θ are
the network parameters (Holzmüller et al., 2023). Its associated kernel is known as the
empirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK) and the posterior mean of this GP approximates
ultra-wide NNs trained with gradient descent (Jacot et al., 2018; Arora et al., 2019; Lee
et al., 2019; Khan et al., 2019; He et al., 2020; Malladi et al., 2023). Kassraie & Krause
(2022) derive bounds of γn under this kernel. If θ is restricted to the weights of the final
linear layer, then this embedding is simply the last-layer embedding.
3. Loss Gradients: Another possible choice is
ϕ(x) = ∇θ ℓ(f(x; θ), ˆy(x))|θ=bθ
where ℓis a loss function, ˆy(x) is the predicted label, and bθ are the current parameter
estimates (Ash et al., 2020).
4. Outputs (eNNGP): Another possible choice is ϕ(x) = f(x), i.e., the output of the network.
Its associated kernel is known as the empirical neural network Gaussian process (eNNGP)
kernel (Lee et al., 2018).
5. Predictive (Kirsch, 2023): Given a Bayesian neural network (Blundell et al., 2015) or
probabilistic (deep) ensemble (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), which induce samples
θ1, . . . , θK ∼p(θ) from the distribution over network parameters, one can approximate the
predictive covariance k(x, x′) = Covθ[f(x; θ), f(x′; θ)]. This kernel measures proximity
in the prediction space rather than parameter space and as such does not require gradient
information. The corresponding feature map is ϕ(x) =
1
√

K [ ¯f(x; θ1) · · · ¯f(x; θK)]⊤
where ¯f(x; θk)
def
= f(x; θk) −1

K
PK
l=1 f(x; θl).

In the additional experiments from this appendix we use last-layer embeddings unless noted otherwise.
We compare the performance of last-layer and the loss gradient embedding
ϕ(x) = ∇θ′ ℓCE(f(x; θ), ˆy(x))|θ=bθ
(45)

where θ′ are the parameters of the final output layer, bθ are the current parameter estimates,
ˆy(x) = arg maxi fi(x; bθ) are the associated predicted labels, and ℓCE denotes the cross-entropy
loss. This gradient embedding captures the potential update direction upon observing a new point
(Ash et al., 2020). Moreover, Ash et al. (2020) show that for most neural networks, the norm of
these gradient embeddings are a conservative lower bound to the norm assumed by taking any other
proxy label ˆy(x). In Figure 8, we observe only negligible differences in performance between this
and the last-layer embedding.

20We observe essentially the same performance with loss gradient embeddings, cf. Appendix J.2.

approximation (Martens & Grosse, 2015) and the loss gradient embeddings from Equation (45). The
results are shown for the MNIST experiment. We do not observe a performance improvement beyond
the trivial approximation Σ = I.

J.3
Towards Uncertainty Quantification in Latent Space

A straightforward and common approximation of the uncertainty about NN weights is given by
Σ = I, and we use this approximation throughout our experiments.

The poor performance of UNSA (cf. Appendix J.5) with this approximation suggests that with more
sophisticated approximations, the performance of ITL, VTL, and CTL can be further improved.
Further research is needed to study the effect of more sophisticated approximations of “uncertainty”
in the latent space. For example, with parameter gradient embeddings, the latent space is the network
parameter space where various approximations of Σ based on Laplace approximation (Daxberger
et al., 2021; Antorán et al., 2022), variational inference (Blundell et al., 2015), or Markov chain
Monte Carlo (Maddox et al., 2019) have been studied. We also evaluate Laplace approximation
(LA, Daxberger et al. (2021)) for estimating Σ but see no improvement (cf. Figure 9). Nevertheless,
we believe that uncertainty quantification is a promising direction for future work, with the potential
to improve performance of ITL and its variations substantially.

Batch Selection via Conditional Embeddings

We will refer to the greedy decision rule from Equation (3) as BACE, short for Batch selection via
Conditional Embeddings. BACE can be implemented efficiently using the Gaussian approximation
of fX from Appendix J.2 by iteratively conditioning on the previously selected points xn,1:i−1, and
updating the kernel matrix KXX using the closed-form formula for the variance of conditional

where j denotes the index of the selected xn,i within X and ρ2 is the noise variance. Note that Kxjxj
is a scalar and KXxj is a row vector, and hence, this iterative update can be implemented efficiently.

We remark that Equation (3) is a natural extension of previous non-adaptive active learning methods,
which typically maximize some notion of “distance” between points in the batch, to the “directed”
setting (Ash et al., 2020; Zanette et al., 2021; Holzmüller et al., 2023; Pacchiano et al., 2024). BACE
simultaneously maximizes “distance” between points in a batch and minimizes “distance” to points
in A.

The sample efficiency of BACE
Bn, and therefore also the greedily constructed B′
n (which gives
a constant-factor approximation with respect to the objective), yields diverse batches by design. In
Figure 10, we compare BACE to selecting the top-b points according to the decision rule (which does
not yield diverse batches). We observe a significant improvement in accuracy and data retrieval when
using BACE. We expect the gap between both approaches to widen further with larger batch sizes.

Computational complexity of BACE
As derived in Appendix G, a single batch selection step
of BACE has complexity O
 
b(k3 + m2)

where b is the size of the batch, k = |A| is the size of
the target space, and m = |S| is the size of the candidate set. In the case of large m, an alternative
implementation whose runtime does not depend on m is described in Appendix G.

J.5
Baselines

In Figure 11, we compare against additional baselines:

• Both TYPICLUST (Hacohen et al., 2022) and PROBCOVER (Yehuda et al., 2022) are recent
methods to select points that “cover” the data distribution well. To maintain comparability
between algorithms, we use the same embeddings as for ITL which are re-computed before
every new batch selection. ITL significantly outperforms TYPICLUST & PROBCOVER,
which only attempt to cover S well without taking A into account (i.e., are “undirected”).

• Mehta et al. (2022) introduced EIG for training neural classification models, which uses the
same decision rule as ITL, but approximates the conditional entropy based on the networks’
softmax output rather than using a GP approximation. We approximate the conditional
entropy using a single gradient step of the hallucinated updates on the parameters of the
final layer, as mentioned by Mehta et al. (2022). We observe that EIG is not competitive for
batch-wise selection (CIFAR-100) since it does not encourage batch diversity. Moreover,
we observe that EIG is orders of magnitude slower than ITL (since it has to compute |S| · C
individual gradient steps where C is the number of classes). We note that since our datasets
are balanced, the AEIG algorithm from Mehta et al. (2022) coincides with EIG.

Figure 11: Comparison to baselines for the experiment of Figure 4.

Since, EIG does not have an open-source implementation, we implemented it ourselves following
Mehta et al. (2022). For TYPICLUST & PROBCOVER, we use the author’s implementation. In the
figure, we show that ITL & VTL substantially outperform all baselines.

In the following, we briefly describe other commonly used “undirected” decision rules.

Denote the softmax distribution over labels i at inputs x by

pi(x; bθ) ∝exp(fi(x; bθ)).

The following heuristics computed based on the softmax distribution aim to quantify the “uncertainty”
about a particular input x:

• MAXENTROPY (Settles & Craven, 2008):

xn = arg max
x∈S
H[p(x; bθn−1)].

• MAXMARGIN (Scheffer et al., 2001; Settles & Craven, 2008):

xn = arg min
x∈S
p1(x; bθn−1) −p2(x; bθn−1)

where p1 and p2 are the two largest class probabilities.

• LEASTCONFIDENCE (Lewis & Gale, 1994; Settles & Craven, 2008; Hendrycks & Gimpel,
2017; Tamkin et al., 2022):

xn = arg min
x∈S
p1(x; bθn−1)

where p1 is the largest class probability.

An alternative class of decision rules aims to select diverse batches by maximizing the distances
between points. Embeddings ϕ(x) induce the (Euclidean) embedding distance

dϕ(x, x′)
def
= ∥ϕ(x) −ϕ(x′)∥2 .

Similarly, a kernel k induces the kernel distance

dk(x, x′)
def
=
q

k(x, x) + k(x′, x′) −2k(x, x′).

It is straightforward to see that if k(x, x′) = ϕ(x)⊤ϕ(x′), then embedding and kernel distances
coincide, i.e., dϕ(x, x′) = dk(x, x′).

49


---Page Break---
• MAXDIST (Holzmüller et al., 2023; Yu & Kim, 2010; Sener & Savarese, 2017; Geifman &
El-Yaniv, 2017) constructs the batch by choosing the point with the maximum distance to
the nearest previously selected point:

xn = arg max
x∈S
min
i<n d(x, xi)

• Similarly, K-MEANS++ (Holzmüller et al., 2023) selects the batch via K-MEANS++ seeding
(Arthur et al., 2007; Ostrovsky et al., 2013). That is, the first centroid x1 is chosen uniformly
at random and the subsequent centroids are chosen with a probability proportional to the
square of the distance to the nearest previously selected centroid:

P(xn = x) ∝min
i<n d(x, xi)2.

When using the loss gradient embeddings from Equation (45), this decision rule is known as
BADGE (Ash et al., 2020).

Finally, we summarize common kernel-based decision rules.

• UNDIRECTED ITL chooses

xn = arg max
x∈S
I(fS; yx | Dn−1)

= arg max
x∈S
I(fx; yx | Dn−1) .

This can be shown to be equivalent to MAXDET (Holzmüller et al., 2023) which selects

xn = arg max
x∈S

Kx + σ2I


where Kx denotes the kernel matrix over x1:n−1∪{x}, conditioned on the prior observations
Dn−1.
• UNSA (Lewis & Catlett, 1994) which with embeddings ϕn−1 after round n −1 corresponds
to:

xn = arg max
x∈S
σ2
n−1(x) = arg max
x∈S

ϕn−1(x)
2
2 .

With batch size b = 1, UNSA coincides with UNDIRECTED ITL. When evaluated with
gradient embeddings, this acquisition function is similar to previously used “embedding
length” or “gradient length” heuristics (Settles & Craven, 2008).
• UNDIRECTED VTL (Cohn, 1993) is the special case of VTL without specified prediction
targets (i.e., A = S). In the literature, this decision rule is also known as BAIT (Holzmüller
et al., 2023; Ash et al., 2021).

We compare to the abovementioned decision rules and summarize the results in Figure 12. We
observe that most “undirected” decision rules perform worse (and often significantly so) than
RANDOM. This is likely due to frequently selecting points from the support of PS which are not
in the support of PA since the points are “adversarial examples” that the model bθ is not trained to
perform well on. In the case of MNIST, the poor performance can also partially be attributed to
the well-known “cold-start problem” (Gao et al., 2020).

In Figure 4, we also compare to the following “directed” decision rules:

• COSINESIMILARITY (Settles & Craven, 2008) selects xn = arg maxx∈S ∠ϕn−1(x, A)
where

∠ϕ(x, A)
def
=
1
|A|

X

x′∈A

ϕ(x)⊤ϕ(x′)
∥ϕ(x)∥2 ∥ϕ(x′)∥2
.

• INFORMATIONDENSITY (Settles & Craven, 2008) is defined as the multiplicative combina-
tion of MAXENTROPY and COSINESIMILARITY:

xn = arg max
x∈S
H[p(x; bθn−1)] ·

∠ϕn−1(x, A)
β

where β > 0 controls the relative importance of both terms. We set β = 1 in our experiments.

Additional experiments

We conduct the following additional experiments:

1. Imbalanced PS (Figure 13): We artificially remove 80% of the support of PA from PS. For
example, in case of MNIST, we remove 80% of the images with labels 3, 6, and 9 from PS.
This makes the learning task more difficult, as PA is less represented in PS, meaning that
the “targets” are more sparse. The trend of ITL outperforming CTL which outperforms
RANDOM is even more pronounced in this setting.
2. Imbalanced A ∼PA (Figure 14): We artificially remove 50% of part of the support of PA
while generating A ∼PA to evaluate the robustness of ITL and CTL in presence of an
imbalanced target space A. Concretely, in case of MNIST, we remove 50% of the images
with labels 3 and 6 from A. In case of CIFAR-100, we remove 50% of the images with
labels {0, . . . , 4} from A. We still observe the same trends as in the other experiments.
3. VTL & choice of k (Figure 15): We observe that VTL performs almost as well as ITL.
Additionally, we evaluate the effect of the number of points k at which the decision rule
is evaluated. Not surprisingly, we observe that the performance of ITL, VTL, and CTL
improves with larger k.
4. Choice of m (Figure 16): Next, we evaluate the choice of m, i.e., the size of the target
space A relative to the number M of candidate points A ∼PA. We write p = m/M. We
generally observe that a larger p leads to better performance (with p = 1 being the best
choice). However, it appears that a smaller p can be beneficial with respect to accuracy
when a large number of batches are selected. We believe that this may be because a smaller
p improves the diversity between selected batches.
5. Choice of M (Figure 17): Finally, we evaluate the choice of M, i.e., the size of A ∼PA.
Not surprisingly, we observe that the performance of ITL improves with larger M.

Ablation study of noise standard deviation ρ

In Table 2, we evaluate the CIFAR-100 experiment with different noise standard deviations ρ. We
observe that the performance of batch selection via conditional embeddings drops (mostly for the less
numerically stable gradient embeddings) if ρ is too small, since this leads to numerical inaccuracies
when computing the conditional embeddings. Apart from this, the effect of ρ is negligible.

Appendix K.2.4).

K
Additional Safe BO Experiments & Details

In Appendix K.1, we discuss the use of stochastic target spaces in the safe BO setting. We provide
a comprehensive overview of prior works in Appendix K.2 and an additional experiment highlighting
that ITL, unlike SAFEOPT, is able to “jump past local barriers” in Appendix K.3. In Appendix K.4,
we provide details on the experiments from Figure 5.

K.1
A More Exploitative Stochastic Target Space

Alternatively to the target space An which comprises all potentially optimal points, we evaluate the
stochastic target space

PAn(·) = P( arg max
x∈X:g(x)≥0
f(x) = · | Dn)
(47)

which effectively weights points in An according to how likely they are to be the safe optimum,
and is therefore more exploitative than the uniformly-weighted target space discussed so far. Samples
from PAn can be obtained efficiently via Thompson sampling (Thompson, 1933; Russo et al., 2018).
Observe that PAn is supported precisely on the set of potential maximizers An. We provide a formal
analysis of stochastic target spaces in Appendix E. Whether transductive active learning with An
or PAn performs better is task-dependent, as we will see in the following.

Note that performing ITL with this target space is analogous to output-space entropy search (Wang &
Jegelka, 2017). Samples from PAn can be obtained via Thompson sampling (Thompson, 1933; Russo
et al., 2018). That is, in iteration n + 1, we sample K ∈N independent functions f (j) ∼f | Dn
from the posterior distribution and select K points x(1), . . . , x(K) which are a safe maximum of
f (1), . . . , f (K), respectively.

Experiments
In Figure 18, we contrast the performance of ITL with PAn to the performance of
ITL with the exact target space An. We observe that their relative performance is instance dependent:
in tasks that require more difficult expansion, ITL with An converges faster, whereas in simpler
tasks (such as the 2d experiment), ITL with PAn converges faster. We compare against the GOOSE
algorithm (Turchetta et al., 2019) which is a heuristic extension of SAFEOPT that explores more
greedily in directions of (assumed) high reward (cf. Appendix K.2.3). GOOSE suffers from the
same limitations as SAFEOPT, which were highlighted in Section 5, and additionally is limited
by its heuristic approach to expansion which fails in the 1d task and safe controller tuning task.
Analogously to our experiments with SAFEOPT, we also compare against ORACLE GOOSE which
has oracle knowledge of the true Lipschitz constants.

The different behaviors of ITL with An and PAn, respectively, as well as SAFEOPT and GOOSE
are illustrated in Figure 19. We observe that ITL with An and SAFEOPT expand the safe set more
“uniformly” since the set of potential maximizers encircles the true safe set.21 Intuitively, this is
because the set of potential maximizers conservatively captures migh points might be safe and

21This is because typically, there will always remain points in bSn \ Sn of which the safety cannot be fully
determined, and since, they cannot be observed, it can also not be ruled out that they have high objective value.

optimal. In contrast, ITL with PAn and GOOSE focus exploration and expansion in those regions
where the objective is likely to be high.

K.2
Detailed Comparison with Prior Works

The most widely used method for Safe BO is SAFEOPT (Sui et al., 2015; Berkenkamp et al., 2021)
which keeps track of separate candidate sets for expansion and exploration and uses UNSA to pick
one of the candidates in each round. Treating expansion and exploration separately, sampling is
directed towards expansion in all directions — even those that are known to be suboptimal. The
safe set is expanded based on a Lipschitz constant of g⋆, which is assumed to be known. In most
real-world settings, this constant is unknown and has to be estimated using the GP. This estimate
is generally conservative and results in suboptimal performance. To this end, Berkenkamp et al.
(2016) proposed HEURISTIC SAFEOPT which relies solely on the confidence intervals of g to expand
the safe set, but lacks convergence guarantees. More recently, Bottero et al. (2022) proposed ISE
which queries parameters from Sn that yield the most “information” about the safety of another
parameter in X. Hence, ISE focuses solely on the expansion of the safe set Sn and does not take into
account the objective f. In practice, this can lead to significantly worse performance on the simplest
of problems (cf. Figure 5). In contrast, ITL balances expansion of and exploration within the safe
set. Furthermore, ISE does not have known convergence guarantees of the kind of Theorem 5.1.
In parallel independent work, Bottero et al. (2024) proposed a combination of ISE and max-value
entropy search (Wang & Jegelka, 2017) for which they derive a similar guarantee to Theorem 5.1.22
Similar to SAFEOPT, their method aims to expand the safe set in all directions including those that are
known to be suboptimal. In contrast, ITL directs expansion only towards potentially optimal regions.

In the 1d task and quadcopter experiment (cf. Figure 5), we observe that SAFEOPT and even ORACLE
SAFEOPT converge significantly slower than ITL to the safe optima. We believe this is due to their
conservative Lipschitz-continuity/global smoothness-based expansion, as opposed to ITL’s expansion,

22We provide an empirical evaluation in Appendix K.2.4.

55


---Page Break---
which adapts to the local smoothness of the constraints. HEURISTIC SAFEOPT, which does not rely
on the Lipschitz constant for expansion, does not efficiently expand the safe set due to its heuristic
that only considers single-step expansion. This is especially the case for the 1d task. Furthermore,
in the 2d task, we notice the suboptimality of ISE since it does not take into account the objective,
and purely aims to expand the safe set. ITL, on the other hand, balances expansion and exploration.

K.2.1
SAFEOPT

SAFEOPT (Sui et al., 2015; Berkenkamp et al., 2021) is a well-known algorithm for Safe BO.

Lipschitz-based expansion
SAFEOPT expands the set of known-to-be safe points by assuming
knowledge of an upper bound Li to the Lipschitz constant of the unknown constraints g⋆
i .23 In each
iteration, the (pessimistic) safe set Sn is updated to include all points which can be reached safely
(with respect to the Lipschitz continuity) from a known-to-be-safe point x ∈Sn. Formally,

SSAFEOPT
n
def
=
[

x∈SSAFEOPT
n−1

{x′ ∈X |

ln,i(x) −Li∥x −x′∥2 ≥0 for all i ∈Is}.

(48)

The expansion of the safe set is illustrated in Figure 20.

We remark two main limitations of this approach. First, the Lipschitz constant is an additional safety
critical hyperparameter of the algorithm, which is typically not known. The RKHS assumption
(cf. Assumption C.25) induces an assumption on the Lipschitz continuity, however, the worst-case
a-priori Lipschitz constant is typically very large, and prohibitive for expansion. Second, the
Lipschitz constant is global property of the unknown function, meaning that it does not adapt to the
local smoothness. For example, a constraint may be “flat” in one direction (permitting straightforward
expansion) and “steep” in another direction (requiring slow expansion). Furthermore, the Lipschitz
constant is constant over time, whereas ITL is able to adapt to the local smoothness and reduce the
(induced) Lipschitz constant over time.

Undirected expansion
SAFEOPT addresses the trade-off between expansion and exploration by
focusing learning on two different sets. First, the set of maximizers

MSAFEOPT
n
def
= {x ∈SSAFEOPT
n
|
un,f(x) ≥
max
x′∈SSAFEOPT
n
ln,f(x)}

which contains all known-to-be-safe points which are potentially optimal. Note that if SSAFEOPT
n
= Sn
then MSAFEOPT
n
⊆An since An contains points which are potentially optimal and potentially safe
but possibly unsafe.

To facilitate expansion, for each point x ∈Sn, the algorithm considers a set of expanding points

F SAFEOPT
n
(x)
def
= {x′ ∈X \ SSAFEOPT
n
|
un,i(x) −Li∥x −x′∥2 ≥0 for all i ∈Is}

A point is expanding if it is unsafe initially and can be (optimistically) deduced as safe by observing
x. The set of expanders corresponds to all known-to-be-safe points which optimistically lead to
expansion of the safe set:

GSAFEOPT
n
def
= {x ∈Sn | |Fn(x)| > 0}.

That is, an expander is a safe point x which is “close” to at least one expanding point x′. Observe that
here, we start with a safe x and then find a close and potentially safe x′ using the Lipschitz-property
of the constraint function. Thus, the set of expanding points is inherently limited by the assumed
Lipschitzness (cf. Figure 20), and generally a subset of the potential expanders En (cf. Equation (27)):

Lemma K.1. For any n ≥0, if SSAFEOPT

= Sn then

23Recall that due to the assumption that ∥g⋆
i ∥k < ∞, g⋆
i is indeed Lipschitz continuous.

Figure 20: Illustration of the expansion of the safe set à la SAFEOPT. Here, the blue region denotes
the pessimistic safe set S, the red region denotes the true safe set S⋆, and the orange region denotes
the optimistic safe set bS. Whereas ITL learns about the point x′ directly, SAFEOPT expands the
safe set using the reduction of uncertainty at x, and then extrapolating using the Lipschitz constant
(cf. Equation (48)). The dashed orange line denotes the expanding points of SAFEOPT which
under-approximate the optimistic safe set of ITL (cf. Lemma K.1). Thus, ITL may even learn about
points in bS which are “out of reach” for SAFEOPT.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we consider the case where Is = {i}. We have

En = bSn \ Sn = {x ∈X \ Sn | un,i(x) ≥0}.

The result follows directly by observing that Li∥x −x′∥2 ≥0.

SAFEOPT then selects xn+1 according to uncertainty sampling within the maximizers and expanders:
MSAFEOPT
n
∪GSAFEOPT
n
. We remark that due to the separate handling of expansion and exploration,
SAFEOPT expands the safe set in all directions — even those that are known to be suboptimal.
In contrast, ITL only expands the safe set in directions that are potentially optimal by balancing
expansion and exploration through the single set of potential maximizers An.

Based on uncertainty sampling
As mentioned in the previous paragraph, SAFEOPT selects as
next point the maximizer/expander with the largest prior uncertainty.24 In contrast, ITL selects the
point within Sn which minimizes the posterior uncertainty within An. Note that the two approaches
are not identical as typically MSAFEOPT
n
∪GSAFEOPT
n
⊂SSAFEOPT
n
and An ̸⊇Sn.

We show empirically in Section 3.3 that depending on the kernel choice (i.e., the smoothness
assumptions), uncertainty sampling within a given target space neglects higher-order information that
can be attained by sampling outside the set. This can be seen even more clearly when considering
linear functions, in which case points outside the maximizers and expanders can be equally
informative as points inside.

Finally, note that the set of expanders is constructed “greedily”, i.e., only considering single-step
expansion. This is necessitated as the inference of safety is based on single reference points. Instead,
ITL directly quantifies the information gained towards the points of interest without considering
intermediate reference points.

Requires homoscedastic noise
SAFEOPT imposes a homoscedasticity assumption on the noise
which is an artifact of the analysis of uncertainty sampling. It is well known that in the presence
of heteroscedastic noise, one has to distinguish epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. Uncertainty
sampling fails because it may continuously sample a high variance point where the variance is
dominated by aleatoric uncertainty, potentially missing out on reducing epistemic uncertainty at
points with small aleatoric uncertainty. In contrast, maximizing mutual information naturally takes

24The use of uncertainty sampling for safe sequential decision-making goes back to Schreiter et al. (2015) and
Sui et al. (2015).

57


---Page Break---
into account the two sources of uncertainty, preferring those points where epistemic uncertainty is
large and aleatoric uncertainty is small (cf. Appendix C.1).

Suboptimal reachable safe set
Sui et al. (2015) and Berkenkamp et al. (2021) show that SAFEOPT
converges to the optimum within the closure ¯RSAFEOPT
ϵ
(S0) of

RSAFEOPT
ϵ
(S)
def
= S ∪{x ∈X | ∃x′ ∈S such that
f ⋆
i (x′) −(Li∥x −x′∥2 + ϵ) ≥0 for all i ∈Is}.

Note that analogously to the expansion of the safe set, the “expansion” of the reachable safe set is
based on “inferring safety” through a reference point in S and using Lipschitz continuity. This is
opposed to the reachable safe set of ITL (cf. Definition C.29).

We remark that under the additional assumption that a Lipschitz constant is known, ITL can easily be
extended to expand its safe set based on the kernel and the Lipschitz constant, resulting in a strictly
larger reachable safe set than SAFEOPT. We leave the concrete formalization of this extension to
future work. Moreover, we do not evaluate this extension in our experiments, as we observe that even
without the additional assumption of a Lipschitz constant, ITL outperforms SAFEOPT in practice.

K.2.2
HEURISTIC SAFEOPT

Berkenkamp et al. (2016) also implement a heuristic variant of SAFEOPT which does not assume a
known Lipschitz constant. This heuristic variant uses the same (pessimistic) safe sets Sn as ITL. The
set of maximizers is identical to SAFEOPT. As expanders, the heuristic variant considers all safe points
x ∈Sn that if x were to be observed next with value un(x) lead to |Sn+1| > |Sn|. We refer to this set
as GH-SAFEOPT
n
. The next point is then selected by uncertainty sampling within MSAFEOPT
n
∪GH-SAFEOPT
n
.

The heuristic variant shares some properties with SAFEOPT, such that it is based on uncertainty
sampling, not adapting to heteroscedastic noise, and separate notions of maximizers and expanders
(leading to an “undirected” expansion of the safe set). Note that there are no known convergence
guarantees for heuristic SAFEOPT. Importantly, note that similar to SAFEOPT the set of expanders
is constructed “greedily”, and in particular, does only take into account single-step expansion. In
contrast, an objective such as ITL which quantifies the “information gained towards expansion” also
actively seeks out multi-step expansion.

K.2.3
GOOSE

To address the “undirected” expansion of SAFEOPT discussed in the previous section, Turchetta
et al. (2019) proposed goal-oriented safe exploration (GOOSE). GOOSE extends any unsafe BO
algorithm (which we subsequently call an oracle) to the safe setting. In our experiments, we evaluate
GOOSE-UCB which uses UCB as oracle and which is also the variant studied by Turchetta et al.
(2019). In the following, we assume for ease of notation that Is = {c}.

Given the oracle proposal x⋆, GOOSE first determines whether x⋆is safe. If x⋆is safe, x⋆is
queried next. Otherwise, GOOSE first learns about the safety of x⋆by querying “expansionist”
points until the oracle’s proposal is determined to be either safe or unsafe.

GOOSE expands the safe set identically to SAFEOPT according to Equation (48). In the context of
GOOSE, SSAFEOPT
n
is called the pessimistic safe set. To determine that a point cannot be deduced as
safe, GOOSE also keeps track of a Lipschitz-based optimistic safe set:

bSGOOSE
n,ϵ
def
=
[

x∈SSAFEOPT
n−1

{x′ ∈X |

un,c(x) −Lc∥x −x′∥2 −ϵ ≥0}.

We summarize the algorithm in Algorithm 2 where we denote by O(X) the oracle proposal over
the domain X.

It remains to discuss the heuristic used to select the “expansionist” points. GOOSE considers all
points x ∈SSAFEOPT
n
with confidence bands of size larger than the accuracy ϵ, i.e.,

WGOOSE
n,ϵ

= {x ∈SSAFEOPT

whether x is safe. We use as heuristic the negative ℓ1-distance between x and x⋆. GOOSE then
considers the set of potential immediate expanders
GGOOSE
n,ϵ
(α)
def
= {x ∈WGOOSE
n,ϵ
| ∃x′ ∈AGOOSE
n,ϵ
with

priority α such that un,c(x) −Lc∥x −x′∥2 ≥0}.

The “expansionist” point selected by GOOSE is then any point in GGOOSE
n,ϵ
(α⋆) where α⋆denotes
the largest priority such that |GGOOSE
n,ϵ
(α⋆)| > 0.

We observe empirically that the sample complexity of GOOSE is not always better than that of
SAFEOPT. Notably, the expansion of the safe set is based on a “greedy” heuristic. Moreover,
determining whether a single oracle proposal x⋆is safe may take significant time. Consider the
(realistic) example where the prior is uniform, and UCB proposes a point which is far away from
the safe set and suboptimal. GOOSE will typically attempt to derive the safety of the proposed point
until the uncertainty at all points within SSAFEOPT
0
is reduced to ϵ.25 Thus, GOOSE can “waste” a
significant number of samples, aiming to expand the safe set towards a known-to-be suboptimal point.
In larger state spaces, due to the greedy nature of the expansion strategy, this can lead to GOOSE
being effectively stuck at a suboptimal point for a significant number of rounds.

K.2.4
ISE and ISE-BO

Recently, Bottero et al. (2022) proposed an information-theoretic approach to efficiently expand the
safe set which they call information-theoretic safe exploration (ISE). Specifically, they choose the
next action xn by approximating
arg max
x∈Sn−1
max
x′∈X I(1{gx′ ≥0}; yx | Dn−1)
|
{z
}
αISE(x)

.
(ISE)

In a parallel independent work, Bottero et al. (2024) extended ISE to the Safe BO problem where
they propose to choose xn according to

arg max
x∈Sn−1
max{αISE(x), αMES(x)}
(ISE-BO)

where αMES denotes the acquisition function of max-value entropy search (Wang & Jegelka,
2017). Similarly to SAFEOPT, ISE-BO treats expansion and exploration separately, which leads
to “undirected” expansion of the safe set. That is, the safe set is expanded in all directions, even
those that are known to be suboptimal. In contrast, ITL balances expansion and exploration through
the single set of potential maximizers An. With a stochastic target space, ITL generalizes max-value
entropy search (cf. Appendix K.1).

We evaluate ISE-BO in Figure 18 and observe that it does not outperform ITL and VTL in any of
the tasks, while performing poorly in the 1d task and suboptimally in the 2d task.

25This is because the proposed point typically remains in the optimistic safe set when it is sufficiently far
away from the pessimistic safe set.

K.3
Jumping Past Local Barriers

In this additional experiment we demonstrate that ITL is able to extrapolate safety beyond local
unsafe “barriers”, which is a fundamental limitation of Lipschitz-based methods such as SAFEOPT.
We consider the ground truth function and prior statistical model shown in Figure 21. Note that
initially, there are three disjoint safe “regions” known to the algorithm corresponding to two of the
three safe “bumps” of the ground truth function. In this experiment, the main challenge is to “jump
past” the local barrier separating the leftmost and initially unknown safe “bump”.

Figure 22 shows the sampled points during the first 100 iterations of SAFEOPT and ITL. Clearly,
SAFEOPT does not discover the third safe “bump” while ITL does. Indeed, it is a fundamental
limitation of Lipschitz-based methods that they can never “jump past local barriers”, even if the oracle
Lipschitz constant were to be known and tight (i.e., locally accurate) around the barrier. This is be-
cause Lipschitz-based methods expand to the point x based on a reference point x′, and by definition,
if x is added to the safe set so are all points on the line segment between x and x′. Hence, if there is a
single point on this line segment which is unsafe (i.e., a “barrier”), the algorithm will never expand past
it. This limitation does not exist for kernel-based algorithms as expansion occurs in function space.

Moreover, note that for a non-stationary kernel such as in this example, ITL samples the “closest
points” in function space rather than Euclidean space. We observe that SAFEOPT still samples
“locally at the boundary” whereas ITL samples the most informative point which in this case is

Synthetic Experiments

1d task
Figure 23 shows the objective and constraint function, as well as the prior. We discretize
using 500 points. The main difficulty in this experiment lies in sufficiently expanding the safe set to
discover the global maximum. Figure 24 plots the size of the safe set Sn for the compared algorithms,
which in this experiment matches the achieved regret closely.

2d task
We model our constraint in the form of a spherical “island” where the goal is to get a good
view of the coral reef located to the north-east of the island while staying in the interior of the island
during exploration (cf. Figure 25). The precise objective and constraint functions are unknown to
the agent. Hence, the agent has to gradually and safely update its belief about boundaries of the
“island” and the location of the coral reef. The prior is obtained by a single observation within the
center of the island [−0.5, 0.5]2. We discretize using 2 500 points.

Safe Controller Tuning for Quadcopter

Modeling the real-world dynamics
We learn a feedback policy (i.e., “control gains”) to compen-
sate for inaccuracies in the initial controller. In our experiment, we model the real world dynamics
and the adjusted model using the PD control feedback (Widmer et al., 2023),

δt(x)
def
= (x⋆−x)[(s⋆−st) (˙s⋆−˙st)],
(49)

where x⋆are the unknown ground truth disturbance parameters, and s⋆and ˙s⋆are the desired state
and state derivative, respectively. This yields the following ground truth dynamics:

st+1(x) = T (st, ut + δt(x)).
(50)

The feedback parameters x = [xp xd]⊤can be split into xp tuning the state difference which
are called proportional parameters and xd tuning the state derivative difference which are called
derivative parameters. We use the “critical damping” heuristic to relate the proportional and
derivative parameters: xd = 2√xp. We thus consider the restricted domain X = [0, 20]4 where
each dimension corresponds to the proportional feedback to one of the four rotors.

Ground truth disturbance parameters are sampled from a chi-squared distribution with one degree
of freedom (i.e., the square of a standard normal distribution), x⋆
p ∼χ2
1, and x⋆
d is determined
according to the critical damping heuristic.

The learning problem
The goal of our learning problem is to move the quadcopter from its
initial position s(0) = [1 1 1]⊤(in Euclidean space with meter as unit) to position s⋆= [0 0 2]⊤.
Moreover, we aim to stabilize the quadcopter at the goal position, and therefore regularize the control
signal towards an action u⋆which results in hovering (approximately) without any disturbances. We
formalize these goals with the following objective function:

f ⋆(x)
def
= −σ

 T
X

t=0
∥s⋆−st(x)∥2
Q + ∥u⋆−ut(x)∥2
R

!

(51)

where σ(v)
def
= tanh((v −100)/100) is used to smoothen the objective function and ensure that its
range is [−1, 1]. The non-smoothed control objective in Equation (51) is known as a linear-quadratic
regulator (LQR) which we solve exactly for the undisturbed system using ILQR (Tu et al., 2023).
Finally, we want to ensure at all times that the quadcopter is at least 0.5 meter above the ground, that
is,

g⋆(x)
def
= min
t∈[T ] sz
t (x) −0.5
(52)

where we denote by sz
t the z-coordinate of state st.

We use a time horizon of T = 3 seconds which we discretize using 100 steps. The objective is
modeled by a zero-mean GP with a Matérn(ν = 5/2) kernel with lengthscale 0.1, and the constraint
is modeled by a GP with mean −0.5 and a Matérn(ν = 5/2) kernel with lengthscale 0.1. The prior
is obtained by a single observation of the “safe seed” [0 0 0 10]⊤.

62


---Page Break---
Adaptive discretization
We discretize the domain X adaptively using coordinate LINEBO
(Kirschner et al., 2019). That is, in each iteration, one of the four control dimensions is selected
uniformly at random, and the active learning oracle is executed on the corresponding one-dimensional
subspace.

Safety
Using the (unsafe) constrained BO algorithm EIC (Gardner et al., 2014) leads constraint
violation,26 while ITL and VTL do not violate the constraints during learning for any of the random
seeds.

Hyperparameters
The observation noise is Gaussian with standard deviation ρ = 0.1. We let
β = 10. The control target is u⋆= [1.766 0 0 0]⊤.

The state space is 12-dimensional where the first three states correspond to the velocity of the
quadcopter, the next three states correspond to its acceleration, the following three states correspond
to its angular velocity, and the last three states correspond to its angular velocity in local frame. The
LQR parameters are given by

Q = diag {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1}
and
R = 0.01 · diag {5, 0.8, 0.8, 0.3}.

The quadcopter simulation was adapted from Chandra (2023).

Each one-dimensional subspace is discretized using 2 000 points.

Random seeds
We repeat the experiment for 25 different seeds where the randomness is over the
ground truth disturbance, observation noise, and the randomness in the algorithm.

26On average, 1.6 iterations of the first 50 violate the constraints.

is compact. Here, Bν is the modified Bessel function. We take the magnitudes from Theorem 5 of
Srinivas et al. (2009) and Remark 2 of Vakili et al. (2021). The notation eO(·) subsumes log-factors.
For ν = 1/2, the Matérn kernel is equivalent to the Laplace kernel. For ν →∞, the Matérn kernel is
equivalent to the Gaussian kernel. The functions sampled from a Matérn kernel are ⌈ν⌉−1 mean
square differentiable. The kernel-agnostic bound follows by simple reduction to a linear kernel in |X|
dimensions.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

65


---Page Break---
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The code is publicly available.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

66


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See the extensive discussions in the appendices.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

67


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All individual experiments require only small compute resources.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine
Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel
must be specifically highlighted here.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

68


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
