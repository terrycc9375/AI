Abstract

Image classification is one of the most fundamental capabilities of machine vision
intelligence. In this work, we revisit the image classification task using visually-
grounded language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V and LLaVA. We find that
existing proprietary and public VLMs, despite often using CLIP as a vision encoder
and having many more parameters, significantly underperform CLIP on standard
image classification benchmarks like ImageNet. To understand the reason, we
explore several hypotheses concerning the inference algorithms, training objectives,
and data processing in VLMs. Our analysis reveals that the primary cause is data-
related: critical information for image classification is encoded in the VLM’s latent
space but can only be effectively decoded with enough training data. Specifically,
there is a strong correlation between the frequency of class exposure during VLM
training and instruction-tuning and the VLM’s performance in those classes; when
trained with sufficient data, VLMs can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art
classification models. Based on these findings, we enhance a VLM by integrating
classification-focused datasets into its training, and demonstrate that the enhanced
classification performance of the VLM transfers to its general capabilities, resulting
in an improvement of 11.8% on the newly collected ImageWikiQA dataset.1

Introduction

The ability to recognize objects within images is a fundamental capability of machine vision. Over the
past 15 years, the field has experienced significant breakthroughs due to deep learning and large-scale
datasets [11, 48]. For instance, on the renowned ImageNet dataset, designed to classify images into
1,000 categories, the error rate has dramatically decreased from 47.1% in 2009 to 9.1% in 2024,
representing a 5-fold reduction [30, 12]. Consequently, these classification models have superseded
most human labelers.

Nowadays, the community has focused on more sophisticated and nuanced capabilities in the
quest for visual intelligence. Visually-grounded language models (VLMs), which integrate visual
signals from vision encoders with large language models, have recently emerged as a promising
paradigm [2, 36, 32]. VLMs like GPT-4V [36], Gemini-1.5 [44], or Claude-3 [3] have demonstrated
advanced visual understanding abilities, such as answering math questions from table images or
generating HTML code from design sketches.

In this work, we revisit the fundamental task of image classification using VLMs. Surprisingly, we
find that various public and proprietary VLMs struggle with image classification in both open-world
settings, where the class list is unknown, and closed-world settings, where class names are provided
in the context (§2). Despite having many more parameters, there is a significant gap between the

CLIP

Figure 1: Overview. (Left) Different visually-grounded language models (VLMs) underperform
CLIP in classification by a large margin, though they often use CLIP as a vision encoder. (Middle)
We investigate several hypotheses about why VLMs are bad classifiers and find that the main reason
is data. Critical information for image classification is encoded in the VLM’s latent space but can
only be decoded with enough data during VLM training. (Right) Based on our analysis, we improve
a VLM by integrating classification data into its training, and find that the improved classification
capabilities serve as foundations for more advanced capabilities such as visual question answering.

performance of VLMs and their commonly used vision encoder CLIP [37]. Our evaluation protocol
involves feeding each image and a list of class names (in the closed-world setting) to the VLM as
context and asking what is in the image; success is defined by whether the generated output contains
the ground-truth class name.

To understand why VLMs underperform in classification settings, we investigate several hypotheses
regarding VLMs’ inference (such as prompt variations, label set size, inference strategy; §3.1),
training (such as information lost, training objective; §3.2), and data (such as data-performance
correlation; §3.3). Our extensive analyses suggest that the primary reason for the observed gap is data.
We find that the information necessary for classification is encoded in the VLM’s latent space but can
only be decoded with proper training data. Specifically, there is a strong correlation between class
presence during VLM training and performance in those classes. Furthermore, training VLMs on
classification datasets achieves the same performance level as state-of-the-art classification models.

Motivated by our analysis, we propose a simple method to enhance VLMs’ general capabilities
by integrating traditional classification-focused datasets into VLM training (§4). We believe that
classification is the foundation for more complex, advanced visual capabilities; for example, recog-
nizing an object is a prerequisite for answering complex questions about it. To verify this, we created
ImageWikiQA, which contains complex real-world questions about ImageNet objects. On ImageWik-
iQA, we find that VLMs fine-tuned on the ImageNet classification dataset achieve substantially higher
accuracy in recognizing these objects and provide more accurate answers to these non-classification
questions, outperforming pre-trained VLMs by 11.8%. This suggests that classical classification data
can be beneficially reused in the VLM training process to enhance VLM performance.

In summary, our contributions are threefold:

• Evaluating VLM classification weaknesses: Our evaluations using ten VLMs across four
benchmarks show that VLMs significantly lag behind CLIP in classification, uncovering a gap
unaddressed by previous research.

• Analyzing causes of poor classification performance: Testing various hypotheses, we find that
the lack of alignment data, rather than information lost or training objective, is the primary reason
for VLMs’ underperformance in classification.

• Enhancing VLMs with classification data: By adding classification data, we improve VLMs’
accuracy in object recognition and overall performance, supporting that classification capability is
foundational for complex object-related reasoning.

VLMs are Bad at Image Classification

We begin by evaluating state-of-the-art visually-grounded language models (VLMs) using standard
image classification benchmarks. Our findings reveal that these VLMs significantly underperform
compared to state-of-the-art classification models, such as CLIP.

2.1
Models

VLMs.
We
selected
ten
widely-used
state-of-the-art
VLMs,
covering
different
archi-
tectures,
training methods,
and data.
These VLMs include three proprietary ones,
GPT-4-Turbo (shortened as GPT4, same below) [36], Gemini-Pro-Vision (GeminiPro) [44],
and Claude-3-Opus (Claude3) [3],
and seven public ones,
LLaVA1.5-Vicuna7B/13B
(LLaVA1.5-7/13B)
[32],
LLaVANeXT-Mistral7B/Vicuna7B
(LLaVANeXT-M7B/V7B)
[31],
BLIP2-OPT2.7B (BLIP2-2.7B) [27], and InstructBLIP-Vicuna7B/13B (IBLIP-7/13B) [10]).
Details of these models are provided in Appendix §A.1.

CLIPs.
For comparison, we used two state-of-the-art image classifiers, CLIP-ViT-L/14-336px
(shortened as CLIP-L, same below) [37] and EVA-ViT-G/14 (EVA-G) [43]. Notably, CLIP-L and
EVA-G are utilized by the LLaVA series [32] and the BLIP series as vision encoders [27], respectively.
Therefore, the VLMs should theoretically have the same classification capacity as these vision models.
Details are listed in Appendix §A.1.

2.2
Data

We evaluated the aforementioned models on four widely-used image classification benchmarks:
ImageNet (shortened as
, same below) [11], Flowers102 (
) [35], StanfordCars (
) [21], and
Caltech101 (
) [13], which contain 50,000, 6,149, 8,041, and 4,331 test images from 1,000, 102,
196, and 101 classes, respectively. ImageNet and Caltech cover more coarse-grained objects, while
Flowers and Cars cover more fine-grained objects. Further details are provided in Appendix §A.2.

2.3
Evaluation Protocol

VLMs.
We performed image classification in two settings: an open-world setting where the label
set is not provided and a closed-world setting where classes are concatenated in the prompt. We

3


---Page Break---
feed the image and the prompt to the VLM and let the VLM complete the rest of the tokens. One
closed-world example is: “<image> What type of object is in this photo? Choose one from <class
name A>, <class name B>, ...” We define success on a single example as whether the ground-truth
label is included in the VLM generation. We report the success rate of all test examples.

CLIPs.
CLIP can only be used in a closed-world setting where the label set is known. Following
Radford et al. [37], we used the prompt “a photo of a <class>” to generate the text feature. For each
image, we selected the class with the highest cosine similarity to the image feature. We did not
include prompt ensembling to fairly compare with VLM. We report the accuracy of all examples.

2.4
Results

Table 1 reports the performance of different VLMs and CLIP models on these classification datasets.

We find that VLMs exhibit poor performance in image classification, significantly lagging behind
CLIP models. For instance, on the ImageNet dataset, the best proprietary VLM, GPT4, only achieves
an accuracy of 60.6% in the closed-world setting, whereas the best CLIP, EVA-G, attains an accuracy
of 79.2%. In the open-world setting, the best public VLM, LLaVANeXT-M7B, achieves just 32.3%
accuracy. The performance disparity is even more pronounced in fine-grained classification datasets
like Flowers102 and StanfordCars. Notably, all LLaVA models use CLIP-L as the vision encoder,
and although the total parameter count of these models is at least 20 times greater than that of the
vision encoder, they significantly underperform compared to it.

Moreover, we find that closed-world setting often outperforms open-world setting. This is expected
as the provided label set narrows the prediction space. However, since closed-world settings require
including all class names in the context, they can result in an extremely long context that leads to
high costs or even exceeds the VLM’s context limit. For example, most public VLMs only support
4K context length, which cannot feed 1K ImageNet classes. We also find that larger and better LMs
slightly improve VLM performance. For instance, LLaVA1.5-13B outperforms LLaVA1.5-7B,
and LLaVANeXT-M7B outperforms LLaVANeXT-V7B.

Why are VLMs Bad Image Classifiers?

Given that visually-grounded language models (VLMs) underperform CLIPs at classification by
a large margin, as reported in §2, we seek to understand the reasons behind that. We investigate
several hypotheses concerning major differences between VLMs and CLIPs, which can be generally
categorized into inference (§3.1), training (§3.2), and data (§3.3):

1. We start with inference-related questions. For example, does prompt variation, such as chain of
thought, affect final performance? Does reducing the label set size in context narrow the gap
between VLMs and CLIPs? Does performing probabilistic inference to force the generation into
the label set help? We find none of these factors can fully close the gap between VLMs and CLIPs.
2. Therefore, we switch to training-related questions. For example, is the visual information from
the vision encoder still preserved in the VLM’s latent space? Is the text generation objective as
effective as cross-entropy loss for learning classification? Surprisingly, the results show that the
information is preserved, and the text generation objective is adequate for learning classification.
3. Finally, we investigate data-related questions. For example, does the VLM training data include
enough classification data and cover enough classes? We find a strong correlation between class
exposure in training and model performance. Moreover, VLMs can achieve the same level of
performance as CLIPs when trained with enough data. These results suggest that data is the
primary cause and effective solution for the poor classification performance of VLMs.

3.1
Inference

In this section, we investigate three questions related to VLM’s inference, including prompt variation,
label set size, and inference strategy.

Prompt variation.
It is well known that language models (LMs) are sensitive to prompts [7, 16, 53].
To understand the effect of prompts on classification performance, we tested three semantically

Table 2: Analysis of VLMs from the inference perspective. (Top) We explore prompt variation
such as wording, label order, chain-of-thought and find it has limited impact on the performance.
(Bottom) We leverage the probabilistic inference strategy, which improves the performance but still
fails to close the gap between VLMs and CLIPs. Results are from the official validation set.

Figure 2: Analysis of the label set size. For each image, we randomly sample 100, 20, 5, 2 candidate
classes from all the classes. The performance gap between VLMs and CLIPs becomes smaller when
the number of classes is reduced. X-axis: number of classes; Y-axis: accuracy (%).

similar but differently worded prompts, compared feeding the label in dataset order or random order
within the context, and leveraged the zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique by
adding “let’s think step by step” at the end of the prompt [47, 20].

We find that prompt variation has a limited impact on the performance. From Table 2, we
can see that changing the wording of prompts results in a performance variation within 3% for
both LLaVA1.5-7B and BLIP2-2.7B on the ImageNet dataset. Different label orderings impact
LLaVA1.5-7B less than BLIP2-2.7B. Chain-of-thought prompting consistently improves perfor-
mance for instruction-tuned model LLaVA1.5-7B but not for BLIP2-2.7B.

Label set size.
The label set size can be very large in practice (e.g., 1000 for ImageNet, 196 for
StanfordCars), which results in an extremely long context when we concatenate all the class names.
Since LMs often struggle with long contexts [33], we explore reducing the number of classes. For
each image, we randomly select K = 2, 5, 20, 100 classes, always including the ground-truth label,
and re-evaluate the VLM and CLIP performance.

We find that the performance gap between VLMs and CLIPs narrows with reduced label size,
but the gap always exists. As shown in Figure 2, when evaluating LLaVA1.5-7B and CLIP-L on
ImageNet, the gap decreases from 46% with 100 classes to 6% with 2 classes. However, the relative
gap becomes larger, evidenced by a 23.9x error rate with 2 classes compared to a 7.3x error rate with
100 classes. The performance gap between VLMs and CLIPs always exists in all the settings.

Inference algorithm.
The default inference algorithm for classification with VLMs is directly
generating the class name given a prompt. As the generation is open-ended, even when provided with a
list of candidate choices, the generation may not match one of the pre-defined classes. To mitigate this
problem, we employ probabilistic inference techniques for VLMs. Specifically, for each class name,

Table 3: Analysis of VLMs from the training perspective. (Left) We conduct feature probing
experiments on the VLM’s last layer and find that the information required for classification is mostly
preserved in the VLM’s latent space. (Right) We fine-tune VLMs on the classification datasets using
the text generation objective and find that the text generation training objective is as effective as the
traditional cross-entropy for learning classification, which eliminates the VLM-CLIP performance
gap, with VLMs now being the state-of-the-art classifier. Results are from the official validation set.

we compute prob(class name|image, prompt) and select the class name with the highest probability
as the prediction. Since class names can consist of multiple tokens (e.g., “guinea pig” consists of
two tokens), we either average the probabilities of all tokens or sum up all the tokens [7]. We also
explore classifier-free guidance (CFG) techniques by ranking t ∗prob(class name|image, prompt) +
(1 −t) ∗prob(class name|prompt) with varying guidance coefficients t [38, 50].

We find that the probabilistic inference method improves the performance, but the gap persists.
As shown in Table 2, LLaVA1.5-7B achieves 35.3% accuracy on ImageNet using probabilistic
inference compared to 22.7% using the direct generation method. Adding classifier-free guidance
further improves the performance, where LLaVA1.5-7B performance boosts to 47.6% on ImageNet.
However, it still leaves around a 30% performance gap between VLMs and CLIPs, as its vision
encoder CLIP-L achieves 74.8% on ImageNet. Moreover, the probabilistic inference approach is
computationally expensive in practice because we need to compute the probability of each class.

3.2
Training

Since inference-based modifications fail to close the performance gap between VLMs and CLIPs,
here we investigate two questions regarding to the training of VLMs. We study whether the visual
information is lost in the VLM and whether the text generation objective is suitable for learning the
classification task.

Visual information lost in the VLM.
VLMs process images using an image encoder, such as
CLIP, which has strong classification capabilities. We hypothesize that, during the propagation of
image features output from the vision encoder in language model layers, the necessary information
for classification is lost. To test this hypothesis, we conduct feature probing experiments. Specifically,
the features from the VLM’s last layer have a shape corresponding to the length of the inputs (image
tokens plus text tokens using the open-world prompt). We take the average of these token features or
the last token feature and train a simple linear classifier on top of these frozen feature representations.
The linear classifier is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set. Training details
are provided in Appendix B.4. A higher accuracy indicates that less information is lost.

Surprisingly, we find that the information necessary for classification is largely preserved in the
VLM’s latent space; however, it cannot be effectively decoded. In Table 3, we show that the probing
accuracy of LLaVA1.5-7B on ImageNet is 77.1%, which is close to the 85.2% probing accuracy of
CLIP-L, the vision encoder used by LLaVA1.5-7B. The same conclusion holds for BLIP2-2.7B and
its vision encoder EVA ViT-G/14, demonstrating that most information is preserved during the VLM
computational process. However, this information cannot be effectively decoded, as §2 shows that
the best accuracy LLaVA1.5-7B can achieve on ImageNet is 47.6%.

Training objective.
Since information is encoded in VLMs, we wonder whether we can train them
to decode the information. VLMs can only be trained to perform classification by auto-regressively
generating text-form labels. We hypothesize that this generative objective may be more difficult and
less effective in learning classification compared to the traditional cross-entropy loss. To understand
the effectiveness of this training objective, we explore fine-tuning VLMs on classification datasets. We

convert classification datasets into the text generation format using the template (e.g., “<image> What
type of object is in this photo? <class name>”). We fine-tune two model architectures (LLaVA1.5-7B
and BLIP2-2.7B) across different datasets and compare their accuracy to that of fine-tuned CLIP
models. Additionally, we investigate fine-tuning different parts of the models, such as only fine-tuning
the projector between vision encoder and language models or fine-tuning the projector along with the
language models using LoRA [17]. Training details are provided in Appendix B.5.

We find that the text generation training objective is as effective as the traditional cross-
entropy for learning classification tasks, which eliminates the performance gap between VLMs
and CLIPs, with VLMs now being the state-of-the-art classifier. From Table 3, we find that
LLaVA1.5-7B achieves 85.7% accuracy on ImageNet, same as 85.2% accuracy when fine-tuning its
vision encoder CLIP-L. The same findings apply to all the VLMs on all the datasets.

Moreover, we find that fine-tuning only the projector is sufficient and has better numerical
stability. From Table 3, we can see the same level of accuracy achieved by fine-tuning the projector
and fine-tuning projector and LLM using LoRA on the three datasets. We also find that fine-
tuning LLM with LoRA often leads to numerical instabilities, such as spikes in loss. While the
loss sometimes returns to normal, other times it does not. For example, despite trying various
hyperparameters for ImageNet, instability persisted (see Appendix §B.5). In contrast, fine-tuning
only the projector always results in a steadily decreasing loss. Notably, the projector is often
much smaller (e.g., a 2-layer MLP in LLaVA) compared to LLMs, suggesting the potential for
parameter-efficient prefix tuning for VLMs [28].

3.3
Data

As observed, the visual information is preserved in the VLM’s latent space, and the VLM’s training
objective is sufficient for learning classification tasks. We hypothesize that the poor classification per-
formance of VLMs is due to their training data. For example, there might be insufficient classification
data or a lack of diverse classes. To investigate this, we analyze the LLaVA1.5-7B training data [32],
the only fully publicly available VLM training dataset. We examined the relationship between the
frequency of class occurrence and the VLM’s classification performance on those classes2.

Our findings indicate that data determines VLM classification performance. As shown in Figure 3,
there is a strong correlation between the presence of class labels in the VLM training data and the
VLM’s classification accuracy for those classes. The LLaVA1.5-7B model achieves 82.7% zero-shot
accuracy on ImageNet classes with more than 10,000 occurrences in its training data, but only
3.0% accuracy on classes with fewer than 10 occurrences. The Spearman correlation between class
frequency and class performance is very high (0.76 on ImageNet; see Appendix §B.6). In contrast,
there is no correlation between its vision encoder CLIP-L’s performance on those classes with the
same VLM training data, and after fine-tuning LLaVA1.5-7B on the ImageNet classification data,
the strong correlation disappears. Combining all of our results, we conclude that data plays a critical
role in determining the VLM’s classification performance.

Given that data availability is critical for VLM classification performance, we now examine whether
the data type specifically impacts results. For instance, to train a VLM to classify a class like “guinea
pig,” should it rely on classification-focused data (e.g., “<image> What type of object is in this photo?

2LLaVA training contains two stages. Here we combine the data from the two stages. More in Appendix B.6.

GPT4 using the same experimental settings as Table 3 and find that data is the main determining
factor for VLM performance, and the data type does not matter much.

Guinea pig”) or can it use broader types, such as caption-focused data (e.g., “<image> Generate a
caption for the image. A guinea pig playing in the grass”) or VQA-focused data (e.g., “<image>
What is the native region of this guinea pig? South America”)?

In previous experiments (see §3.2), we fine-tuned the VLM with a classification-focused template.
Here, we fine-tune the VLM on caption-focused data generated by prompting GPT4 to produce
captions incorporating each class’s ground-truth name. Specifically, we used the prompt: “Generate a
short caption for the image. The caption must include the ground-truth label of the image, which is
<class name>.” This approach produces diverse captions per class, such as “A guinea pig playing in
the grass” or “A close-up view of a guinea pig in an indoor environment.” We then fine-tune the VLM
on this caption-focused data using identical experimental settings and evaluate it against the model
trained with classification-focused data. Success is determined by whether the generated caption for
a validation image includes the ground-truth class name.

We find that data presence is the primary factor for VLM classification performance, with data
type playing a minimal role. From Table 4, we observe that models fine-tuned on both classification-
and caption-focused data perform similarly on Flowers102, StanfordCars, and Caltech101, achieving
accuracy gains of at least 48.6% over the non-fine-tuned model. This suggests that enabling a VLM
to classify a specific class does not require classification-specific data; any data containing the class
name suffices.

These findings emphasize a critical data-centric view of VLM training. A common question for
VLM training is whether alignment between vision encoder outputs and text generation necessitates
multi-modal data with specific class labels, despite both vision and language components seeing these
classes in uni-modal pre-training. Previous studies have suggested that this alignment stage may be
data-efficient or even unnecessary [32, 18], likely due to their evaluation settings not requiring vision-
centric fine-grained recognition. Our work, however, shows that 1) multi-modal data is essential
for alignment and 2) increasing data quantity linearly boosts performance. Concurrent work from
DeepMind supports our findings, showing that most VLM tasks benefit from pre-training on larger
datasets [6].

Improving VLM with Classification Data

Based on the analysis presented in §3, in this section, we discuss the enhancement of visually-
grounded language models (VLMs) by integrating classification-focused data into their training. We
demonstrate that this data intervention not only boosts the VLM’s classification performance but also
enhances its general capabilities.

4.1
Motivation

Classification is fundamental to enabling more advanced capabilities of VLMs, such as visual
question answering and reasoning. For example, suppose a virtual assistant is helping visually
impaired individuals prepare mushrooms as food. In that case, the model must correctly identify the
mushroom species to answer questions like “Is this mushroom poisonous?” The poor classification
performance of VLMs lays a weak foundation for their advanced capabilities.

From §3, we identify the primary cause of poor classification performance is the lack of data.
Therefore, we propose a straightforward solution: integrating classification-focused data into the
VLM training process. We hope that incorporating classification data not only enhances classification
accuracy but also improves general capabilities.

Table 5: Evaluations of VLMs on ImageWikiQA. ImageWikiQA is a multiple-choice question-
answering dataset collected by feeding the Wikipedia pages of ImageNet classes to GPT-4. We
find that current VLMs perform poorly in answering these questions, suggesting that their poor
classification performance is a fundamental limitation for more advanced capabilities. Integrating
classification data into VLM training enhances both their classification and overall capabilities.

4.2
ImageWikiQA

To verify our hypothesis, we need a dataset that evaluates both the classification and advanced
capabilities of VLMs. However, current visual question answering benchmarks, such as VQAv2 [15],
MM-Vet [51], and MMMU [52], primarily focus on advanced capabilities, such as reasoning and
knowledge grounding, rather than classification. The objects in these datasets are relatively simple,
and questions can often be answered by identifying only the general category of an image, such as
“mushroom” or “flower”, rather than specific types of mushrooms or flowers. In contrast, classification
datasets have no questions related to more advanced capabilities.

To bridge the gap between classification and advanced capabilities, we introduce ImageWikiQA, an
object-centric, knowledge-intensive question answering dataset that combines both worlds. Each
question in ImageWikiQA is a multiple-choice question with four options and one correct answer
(e.g., “<image showing a guinea pig> What is the native region of this object? A. South America;
B. Africa; C. Asia; D. Australia”). Although each question does not directly ask for the category of
the object within the image, the question can only be accurately answered if the class of the object
is correctly identified. Example questions from ImageWikiQA can be found in Figure 1 (right) and
Appendix §C.1.

ImageWikiQA is created by generating questions based on Wikipedia pages of ImageNet classes
using GPT4. Specifically, for each class in ImageNet, we parsed the Wikipedia content of the class
following Bujwid et al. [8], and then provided this content along with a prompt to GPT4 to generate
five questions per class. We instructed GPT4 to replace the class name with “this object” in the
questions so that the ground-truth class name is not provided. We retained all questions that GPT4
could answer correctly with the ground-truth class name and could not guess the answer without the
class name. To ensure the question quality generated by GPT4, four human annotators attempted to
answer the questions with the ground-truth class name and Wikipedia page and achieved an accuracy
of 96.5%. Afterward, we randomly sampled at most 3 ImageNet images for each question, rebalanced
the choice distribution, and composed the final ImageWikiQA dataset. In total, there are 2000
multiple-choice questions, each with an image, question, four candidate choices, and a reference to
Wikipedia sentences, with a random guess accuracy of 25.0% and max frequency accuracy of 25.9%.

4.3
Results

Table 5 presents the performance of various VLMs on the ImageWikiQA dataset.

We find that current state-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly on answering these questions given
images. For example, GPT4 achieves 100% accuracy when the ground-truth class name is pro-
vided, but only achieves 61.2% accuracy with images. Similarly, Claude3 and GeminiPro only
achieve 54.3% and 49.1% accuracy, respectively. These results indicate that the poor classification
performance of VLMs is a fundamental limitation for more advanced capabilities.

---Page Break---
Furthermore, we find that integrating classification data into VLM training improves its classifi-
cation and general capabilities. We fine-tuned LLaVA1.5-7B on the ImageNet 1.28M classification
data and original 665K LLaVA instruction-tuning data (training detail in §C.2), which is able to
achieve 84.4% accuracy on ImageNet classification compared to 22.8% for non-fine-tuned models.
This improvement in classification translates to an 11.8% accuracy boost on ImageWikiQA, demon-
strating classification is indeed a foundation for VLM’s advanced capabilities. However, it is worth
noting that fine-tuning solely on the classification task harms general capabilities. When fine-tuning
LLaVA1.5-7B on ImageNet only, their accuracy on ImageWikiQA drops to 30.6%. Therefore, fine-
tuning should be performed on a combined dataset. Developing fine-tuning methods that prevent
such catastrophic forgetting is a promising future research direction.

Related Work

Visually-grounded language models.
Visually-grounded language models (VLMs) refer to a
large family of models that integrate visual signals into language models by modeling p(yt|y<t, x),
where yi is a text token and x is a visual input such as an image or video. Recently, many powerful
VLMs have been developed, including proprietary ones like GPT-4V [36], Gemini [44], Claude [3],
Flamingo [2] and public ones like LLaVA [32, 31], BLIP [27, 10], OpenFlamingo [4], Otter [26],
Fuyu [1], QwenVL [5]. The typical architecture of VLMs comprises three components: a visual
encoder (often CLIP [37]), a language model, and a projector that bridges the visual outputs and
language model inputs. The projector can be as simple as a linear layer or MLP (e.g., LLaVA [32])
or a complex architecture such as Transformer with cross-modal attention (e.g., BLIP [27]). VLMs
are usually trained on image-text captioning data [40, 39] and carefully designed instruction-tuning
data [32], with both the vision encoder and language model initialized from pre-trained versions.
In this work, we evaluate widely used VLMs in classification settings and analyze two prominent
architectures, LLaVA [32] and BLIP [27].

Analysis of visually-grounded language models.
While VLMs have demonstrated impressive
performance, many questions remain unanswered. Recent works have explored their limitations
from various perspectives, including architectures [34], training recipes [18, 24], data [14, 46], vision
encoders [45], language models [2, 44], input resolution [41], and proposed solutions for these
limitations. For instance, Tong et al. [45] discovered that CLIP vision encoders, employed by most
VLMs, often fail to distinguish between certain image pairs despite their apparent visual differences.
They suggested utilizing alternative vision encoders, such as DINO, to address this problem. Our
work aligns with these studies in understanding VLM limitations and proposing solutions. We find
that current VLMs struggle with image classification, and we thoroughly investigate the reasons
behind this, proposing a simple solution to integrate classification-focused data into VLM training.

Image classification.
Image classification is one of the most fundamental capabilities of machine
intelligence. Starting in the 1990s, researchers collected datasets like MNIST [25] for digit classi-
fication and CIFAR [22] for object classification, using various machine learning algorithms such
as SVMs and MLPs to tackle the problem. A significant milestone was the ImageNet [11], which
elevated the scale and quality of datasets to a new level, driving advancements in deep learning.
With the rise of deep supervised and self-supervised learning [23, 9], performance on these datasets
soon began to saturate. As a result, classification models have superseded most human labelers,
leading researchers to focus on more advanced visual intelligence tasks like visual reasoning. In this
work, we revisit this simple yet fundamental task, discovering that current VLMs struggle with it.
We demonstrate that classification remains essential, as it forms the foundation for more advanced
capabilities, and enhancing VLMs’ classification capabilities improves their overall performance.

Conclusion

In this work, we explored the use of visually-grounded language models (VLMs) as image classifiers.
We found that their performance is limited across various datasets. We then analyzed the reasons
behind these limitations and, based on our findings, trained a VLM with enhanced general capabilities.

Broader Impacts and Ethics Statement

In this work, we identify a core limitation of visually-grounded language models (VLMs) and propose
a simple solution to address this issue. We find that VLMs underperform in image classification.
By integrating classification data into VLM training, we have demonstrated that this intervention
not only enhances classification accuracy but also improves the general capabilities of VLMs. This
advancement holds promise for real-world applications, such as virtual assistants for visually impaired
individuals. However, there are potential risks associated with incorporating race-based or gender-
based classification data, which could amplify discriminatory biases in VLMs. We strongly emphasize
the importance of ethical and responsible use of our approach to ensure it contributes positively to
our digital ecosystem.

Reproducibility Statement

We provide an open-source implementation of our work and have released the ImageWikiQA dataset at
https://github.com/yuhui-zh15/VLMClassifier. This will enable researchers to reproduce
all experiments described in this paper and conduct their own analyses on additional VLMs and
datasets.

Limitations

Due to computational constraints, we cannot evaluate all possible VLMs and datasets. We select
two representative ones, LLaVA and BLIP, and conduct analyses on four datasets. Additionally, as
we find that VLMs have information in their latent space, we conduct large-scale training to decode
them. Developing a zero-shot method to decode this information without extensive training could be
a promising direction for future research.

Compute Resources

We use four NVIDIA L40S GPUs for all experiments. Most inference experiments take 5-20
hours on a single L40S GPU. The most computationally intensive step is fine-tuning. Fine-tuning
LLaVA1.5-7B on 1.28M ImageNet data takes 1.4 days for one epoch using four GPUs. Fine-tuning
LLaVA1.5-7B on 1.28M ImageNet data combined with 665K original LLaVA instruction-tuning
data takes 3.5 days for one epoch using four GPUs. For the 13B model, the cost is approximately
40% higher.

Synonymous Text Labels in ImageNet Evaluation

In ImageNet, many classes have multiple valid textual labels. For instance, the class identifier
n01496331 corresponds to both “electric ray” and “crampfish”. To address this, we incorporated
label synonyms3 in our evaluation. We treat the classification as correct if any textual label is included
in the VLM generation. Including synonyms improves accuracy by only 1%-3% (Table 8), still
leaving a notable performance gap when compared to CLIP.

Table 9: Analysis of the label set size. This is the table version of Figure 2.

B.2
Label Set Size Details

Performance details.
The table version of Figure 2 is provided in Table 9. By reducing the number
of labels for classification, we can narrow the gap between VLM and CLIP, but a gap remains across
all label set sizes, even with just two labels (two-way classification).

Relative performance gaps.
We find that while the absolute gap between VLMs and CLIPs
narrows with reduced label size, the relative gap increases. For example, in two-way classification on
ImageNet, VLMs have a 5.7% error rate, while CLIP has a 0.2% error rate, resulting in a 28.5x gap;
for 20 classes, VLMs have an 18.0% error rate, while CLIP has a 2.5% error rate, resulting in a 7.2x
gap. This trend is indicated by the error rates between VLMs and CLIP shown in Figure 4.

Larger gap on fine-grained classification datasets.
The absolute gap on Flowers and Cars is larger
than ImageNet and Caltech when reducing the label set size. This may be because Flowers and Cars
are more fine-grained classification datasets, while ImageNet and Caltech are more coarse-grained.
VLMs are weaker in fine-grained classification compared to CLIP, resulting in a larger gap.

B.3
Inference Strategy Details

Experimental details.
Probabilistic inference methods require separate computations for each
class, which introduces significant computational costs. For example, on ImageNet with 1000 classes,
each example takes 1000 times longer to process than with a direct generation pipeline. Therefore,
we randomly sampled 1000 examples from each dataset’s validation set for evaluation.

than probing other token positions. Experiments are done using LLaVA1.5-7B on the Flowers102
dataset.

B.4
Information Loss Details

CLIP global vs. local features.
The global feature of CLIP is commonly used in traditional
classification settings, which has 1 token for each image. However, VLMs utilize local patch features
for classification, which has 576 tokens for each image using CLIP-L. One might hypothesize that
local features contain less information than global features. In practice, VLMs use the second-to-last
layer of CLIP local features rather than the last layer. Since the last layer’s global feature is the
weighted average of the second-to-last layer’s features through self-attention computation, we can
theoretically conclude that local features have at least the same level of information as CLIP global
features.

Feature extraction details.
We extract features from VLM’s last layer by feeding the LLaVA
default prompt “USER: <576 Image Tokens> What type of object is in this photo? ASSISTANT:”
into the LLaVA, or BLIP default prompt “<Image Tokens> Question: What type of object is in this
photo? Answer:” into the BLIP. We use either the last token feature (i.e., the token “:”) or the average
feature over all the tokens.

Linear probing details.
We train the linear layer on the training set with a batch size of 512, a
learning rate of 1e-3 using the Adam optimizer, and for 500 epochs. After training, we report the best
performance on the validation set.

Probing position.
In practice, we find that probing the last token or the average token results in
much better performance than probing other token positions, as shown in Table 10. We leave this as
an interesting question for future research.

B.5
Training Objective Detail

LLaVA fine-tuning details.
We convert each image and class label into the text format using
the LLaVA default template “USER: <576 Image Tokens> What type of object is in this photo?
ASSISTANT: <Class Name>.” We conduct two settings for fine-tuning LLaVA. In the first setting,
we only fine-tune the MLP projector between CLIP and the language model (LM). The projector
is trained on the training set with a batch size of 64 and a learning rate of 2e-5 using the AdamW
optimizer for 50 epochs (1 epoch for ImageNet), with a warmup ratio of 0.03. In the second setting,
we fine-tune both the MLP projector and the LM using LoRA. The projector and LM are trained on
the training set with a batch size of 64, a learning rate of 2e-5 for the projector and 2e-4 for the LM,
using the AdamW optimizer for 50 epochs (1 epoch for ImageNet), with a warmup ratio of 0.03, a
LoRA rank of 128, and a LoRA alpha of 256. For both settings, we report the best performance on
the validation set after training. Fine-tuning on ImageNet for 1 epoch requires 130 L40 GPU hours.

BLIP fine-tuning details.
We convert each image and class label into the text format using the
BLIP default template “<Image Tokens> Question: What type of object is in this photo? Answer:
<Class Name>.” We train the Q-former projector between CLIP and the LM on the training set with a
batch size of 64, a learning rate of 2e-5, and a weight decay of 0.05 using the AdamW optimizer for
100 epochs (10 epochs for ImageNet), with 1000 warmup steps. After training, we report the best
performance on the validation set. Fine-tuning on ImageNet for 10 epochs requires 120 L40 GPU
hours.

CLIP fine-tuning details.
We initialize a linear layer on top of the CLIP image encoder. The CLIP
model is frozen, and only the linear layer is trained. The linear layer is trained on the training set with
a batch size of 512, a learning rate of 1e-3, and no weight decay using the Adam optimizer for 300
epochs (40 epochs for ImageNet). After training, we report the best performance on the validation
set.

Figure 5: Fine-tuning only the projector improves numerical stability. (Top) Fine-tuning LLMs
with LoRA often results in numerical instabilities, manifesting as spikes in loss (purple, green, brown,
orange curves). In contrast, fine-tuning only the projector leads to a consistently steady decrease in
loss (teal curve). Despite experimenting with various hyperparameters for ImageNet, the instability
remained. (Bottom) Occasionally, the spikes normalize with continued training. Here, we present an
example using the StanfordCars dataset (pink curve).

Numerical instability.
When fine-tuning both the projector and the LM with LoRA for LLaVA,
we experience significant numerical instability. On ImageNet, despite adjusting three different
hyperparameters such as the learning rate and batch size, the loss consistently peaks during training
and does not recover. On the StanfordCars dataset, numerical instability is also observed, but the loss
returns to normal during training. This can be seen in Figure 5.

Table 12: Analysis of VLMs from the inference perspective. Compared to Table 2, we added the
results for the proprietary GPT4 model. We explore prompt variation such as label order and chain-
of-thought (CoT) and find it has a limited impact on the performance, which applies to proprietary
VLMs such as GPT4.

Figure 6: Analysis of the label set size. Compared to Figure 2, we added the line for the proprietary
GPT4 model. LLaVA1.5-7B uses CLIP-L as its vision encoder, while GPT4 presumably employs a
superior vision encoder. Therefore, comparing GPT4 to CLIP-L is not entirely fair. However, we
observe that GPT4 performs worse than CLIP-L on ImageNet even when the number of classes is
reduced to 2.

B.6
Data Detail

Data processing details.
The training of LLaVA comprises two stages: pre-training and instruction
tuning. The pre-training stage utilizes noisy image captioning data, whereas the instruction tuning
stage employs meticulously curated multi-turn conversation data. We tokenize all sentences within
the data, compute the frequency for each class, and then calculate the accuracy for each class. This
results in 1000 (frequency, accuracy) pairs for ImageNet’s 1000 classes. This process is similarly
applied to all other datasets.

Correlation results.
We compute the Spearman and Pearson correlations between frequency and
accuracy of zero-shot LLaVA1.5-7B. The results are presented in Table 11. For comparison, we
conducted the same analysis for CLIP-L and fine-tuned LLaVA1.5-7B.

Correlation for two stages.
Given that LLaVA training involves two stages, we examine whether
pre-training or instruction-tuning data has a greater impact on classification performance. We
compute the Spearman and Pearson correlations separately for pre-training and instruction-tuning
data. Our findings indicate that the correlation is similar for both stages. For instance, on ImageNet,
the Spearman and Pearson correlations are 0.73 and 0.34 for pre-training, and 0.76 and 0.33 for
instruction tuning. These values are close to the combined data correlations, which are 0.76 and 0.35
for Spearman and Pearson correlations, respectively, as reported in Table 11.

B.7
Analysis of Proprietary VLMs

In the main paper, we analyzed two public VLMs about why they are bad at image classification. For
proprietary VLMs, they haven’t released the training details and data usage, so it is impossible to
directly address training-related or data-related hypotheses.

For inference-related hypotheses, we conduct additional experiments with GPT4 (Table 12, Figure 6),
and the conclusion is the same as the public VLMs. For example, GPT-4 achieves 60.6% accuracy on
ImageNet without CoT. With CoT, GPT-4 achieves 62.2% accuracy, demonstrating that CoT has a
limited impact on image classification, even for large VLMs.

19


---Page Break---
For training-related and data-related hypotheses, recent work PaliGemma [6] from DeepMind shows
that most VLM tasks benefit significantly from longer pre-training with more data (in its Figure 4
and Appendix K). This aligns with our main conclusion that data is the critical factor in improving
VLM performance.

B.8
Open-world vs. Closed-world Setting

§3 and §4 all use “open-world” settings (not providing the label set in the prompt), except for prompt
variation analysis and label set size analysis in §3.1, using “closed-world” settings (providing the
label set in the prompt).

Naturally, the “closed-world” setting narrows the model’s generation space and increases accuracy.
When the model can easily predict the class in the label set by modifying the inference space
(probabilistic inference in §3.1 and probing VLM in §3.2) or training VLMs with more classification
data (§4), the advantage of the “closed-world” setting doesn’t exist. Thus, for these experiments, we
use the “open-world” setting.

B.9
Number Comparison of Table 1 vs. Table 2

Table 2’s “Base Prompt w/ Label (Random Order)” is equivalent to Table 1’s “Closed-World Setting”.
In this setting, we concatenate label candidates in a random order for each question: “What’s in the
image? Choose one from random_shuffle([cat, dog, pig])”. The accuracy for these two settings is
identical between Table 2 and Table 1.

Table 2’s “Base Prompt w/ Label (Fixed Order)” concatenates label candidates in a fixed order for
each question: “What’s in the image? Choose one from [cat, dog, pig]”. This setting is used to rule
out the possibility that the order of labels might affect model performance.

B.10
Why Do VLMs Have Information but Cannot Decode?

In 3, we find that VLMs have the essential information for classification. If the VLMs have the
information, then why are they not able to decode it?

One possible reason is that the VLM’s decoding space is too large and not aligned with the visual
features. Specifically, VLM decoding is performed through next-word prediction, which usually
involves a vocabulary of over 10,000 words. The output text embedding is not aligned with the visual
features due to insufficient data to align these spaces.

In general, having information in a model does not necessarily mean the model can express that
information. This phenomenon is also observed in other research areas. For example, after training
ResNets or ViTs with self-supervised learning methods like SimCLR, the model acquires discrimina-
tive information for different classes. However, this information can only be decoded by adding and
training a linear layer on a new dataset.

Similarly, we demonstrate that VLMs possess classification information, but it is not readily express-
ible. Adding classification-related data helps bridge the gap between “information possession” and
“information expression” (refer to Table 3).

B.11
Why Does Fine-tuning Only on ImageNet Get Worse Performance on ImageWikiQA?

In Table 5, the “Finetuned on ImageNet” model performance (30.6) is worse than the non-finetuned
model performance (38.0). This is because fine-tuning often improves in-distribution performance
but does not necessarily enhance out-of-distribution or general capabilities.

Table 5 presents the results of models fine-tuned on ImageNet and evaluated on ImageWikiQA,
which are vastly different datasets. ImageNet questions only require classification, such as “Q:
<image> What is in the image? A: dog,” while ImageWikiQA questions demand both classification
and knowledge/reasoning, such as “Q: <image> What is the native region of this object? A: South
America.”

Fine-tuning solely on ImageNet trains the model to classify, but it can lead to a loss of general
capabilities like reasoning and knowledge, resulting in lower performance on ImageWikiQA (30.6
fine-tuned vs. 38.0 pre-trained). This phenomenon is known as “catastrophic forgetting” [19].

Figure 7: Analysis of linear probed VLM from the data perspective. Compared to Figure 3, we
added the line for the linear probed LLaVA model, which has zero correlation. The zero correlation is
expected because probing on the ImageNet dataset equalizes class frequencies, as ImageNet classes
are evenly distributed.

However, when we fine-tune on both ImageNet and instruction tuning data, the model learns classifi-
cation while retaining its original capabilities, leading to a significant performance improvement on
ImageWikiQA (49.8 fine-tuned vs. 38.0 pre-trained).

B.12
Analysis of Linear Probed VLM from Data Perspective

Figure 7 plots results for the linear probed LLaVA model, which aligns closely with the fine-tuned
LLaVA. This alignment shows a zero correlation with class frequency since fine-tuning or probing on
the balanced ImageNet dataset equalizes class frequencies, where each class is evenly represented.

ImageWikiQA Details

Data collection details.
ImageWikiQA only contains a test set, providing a valuable benchmark
for assessing both fine-grained classification and knowledge-based reasoning in VLMs.

The ImageWikiQA dataset was constructed in two stages. In the first stage, we generated questions
at the class level for each of the 1,000 ImageNet classes. For instance, questions like “What is the
native region of <class name>?” were created to capture high-level class information. In the second
stage, we refined these questions at the image level. For each ImageNet class, we randomly sampled
3 images from the 50 available images from the ImageNet validation set and formulated specific
questions like “What is the native region of <image i>?”. Each question in ImageWikiQA is paired
with a single image, ensuring only one image per question.

The ImageWikiQA dataset contains 2,000 unique questions. A question like “What is the native
region of <image i>?” is counted multiple times if it is asked for different images or classes. For
example, if the question is asked for 2 cat images and 2 dog images, it would count as 4 questions in
total. To avoid over-representing any particular question, a question like “What is the native region of
<image i>?” is limited to a maximum of 3 occurrences across the 2,000 questions.

Data generation prompt.
We provide the prompt used to generate ImageWikiQA in Figure 8 and
the prompt used to filter ImageWikiQA in Figure 9.

LLaVA fine-tuning details.
For ImageNet, we convert each image and class label into the text

tuning dataset with the 1.28M ImageNet classification dataset. Due to numerical stability concerns,
we train only the projector layer of LLaVA. The projector is trained on the combined dataset with a
batch size of 64, a learning rate of 2e-5, using the AdamW optimizer, for 1 epoch, with a warmup
ratio of 0.03. The training process takes approximately 340 hours on a single L40 GPU.

Performance of Fine-tuned VLM on Other Datasets

To understand whether incorporating the ImageNet 1.28M classification data into the original LLaVA
instruction-tuning data will harm the model’s general capability, we further evaluated the performance
of our fine-tuned visually-grounded language model (VLM) on additional benchmarks to ensure its
robustness across a variety of tasks. In particular, we tested the model on TextVQA [42], POPE [29],
and MMVet [51]. The results, presented in Table 13, show that the fine-tuned LLaVA1.5-7B maintains
almost identical performance compared to the original version.

This result aligns with expectations since our fine-tuning process incorporated all of the original
LLaVA training data during instruction tuning. For instance, on TextVQA, the fine-tuned model
achieved an accuracy of 58.0%, closely matching the original model’s 58.2%. Additionally, the fine-
tuned model slightly outperformed the original on POPE Popular and POPE Adverse benchmarks,
showing small improvements of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. Performance on MMVet remained

Low Accuracy on ImageWikiQA with Ground-truth Class Names

Table 5 presents the accuracy on ImageWikiQA, which includes questions derived from Wikipedia
requiring extensive world knowledge (e.g., “What is the native region of the guinea pig?”).

The modest accuracy of 55.9% by LLaVA1.5-7B with provided ground-truth class names reflects
its limited world knowledge for ImageNet classes. This limitation aligns with findings that smaller
models, like Vicuna-7B, lack world knowledge compared to larger models like GPT-4.

C.5
Other Fine-Tuning and Inference Strategies

Other fine-tuning or inference modifications, such as applying a linear probing loss in the VLM output
space during training or using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) in the VLM output space for evaluation,
can also enhance VLM classification performance.

However, our primary goal is to improve VLMs’ general capabilities across a range of tasks, not
just classification. The universal inference interface for various tasks is text generation, whereas
approaches like KNN-based inference are tailored solely to classification and do not generalize
to other task types. For fine-tuning, we experimented with adding a new token and applying a
linear probing loss. This approach did not yield improvements on ImageWikiQA, indicating that
task-specific fine-tuning does not enhance the overall capabilities of VLMs.

In summary, without changing VLM training or inference to maintain its general capabilities for
different tasks, adding data is the most promising and effective approach.

D
Summary of Contributions

Object recognition is fundamental to the general capability of visually-grounded language models
(VLMs), yet current VLMs perform poorly in this area. We are the first to thoroughly investigate this
critical issue and propose a potential solution to improve it.

Our primary contribution lies in identifying the problem (i.e., VLMs are inadequate image
classifiers, a significant weakness that has been overlooked) and conducting an in-depth in-
vestigation (i.e., understanding why VLMs are poor image classifiers and how to address this
issue).

In summary, our contributions are threefold:

• Thorough Evaluation to Identify the Problem: We thoroughly evaluated current public and
proprietary VLMs on four common classification benchmarks and discovered that their performance
significantly lags behind CLIP. This finding is counterintuitive because VLMs often use CLIP as
their vision encoders. This finding reveals a weakness in VLMs that previous works have not
widely noted [2, 49]. Understanding the limitations of VLMs is crucial given their increasing
deployment in various scenarios.

• Hypothesis Testing to Understand the Problem: Given the poor performance of VLMs in
classification, we investigated the underlying reasons. We considered multiple plausible hypotheses
related to VLM inference, training, and data perspectives. For example, essential information for
classification could be lost during the vision encoder’s propagation through multiple LLM
layers; VLMs might be inherently poor at classification due to their text generation training
objective compared to the standard cross-entropy objective. Our thorough investigation ruled

23


---Page Break---
out these reasons but revealed the major issue: the lack of alignment data. This finding is
counterintuitive because other alternative hypotheses also seemed plausible.
• Improving VLMs based on Our Understanding: Based on our findings, we explored ways
to enhance VLM performance. We believe that classification is foundational to more advanced
capabilities. For example, if a VLM cannot accurately classify mushroom species, it will also
struggle with follow-up questions, such as whether a particular mushroom is poisonous. Indeed,
we found that simply adding classification data not only improves VLMs’ classification
performance but also their general capabilities, demonstrating that accurately identifying
objects is a prerequisite for answering complex questions about these objects.

Impact:
Recent work from Google DeepMind, PaliGemma [6], supports our main conclusion that
data is the critical factor in improving VLM performance. They also found that most VLM tasks
benefit significantly from longer pre-training with more data (Appendix K). This demonstrates that
our analysis can inspire researchers to build better VLMs in the future.
