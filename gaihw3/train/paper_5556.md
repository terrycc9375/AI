Abstract

Presently, pseudo-labeling stands as a prevailing approach in cross-domain se-
mantic segmentation, enhancing model efficacy by training with pixels assigned
with reliable pseudo-labels. However, we identify two key limitations within this
paradigm: (1) under relatively severe domain shifts, most selected reliable pixels
appear speckled and remain noisy. (2) when dealing with wild data, some pixels
belonging to the open-set class may exhibit high confidence and also appear speck-
led. These two points make it difficult for the pixel-level selection mechanism to
identify and correct these speckled close- and open-set noises. As a result, error
accumulation is continuously introduced into subsequent self-training, leading
to inefficiencies in pseudo-labeling. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel method called Semantic Connectivity-driven Pseudo-labeling (SeCo). SeCo
formulates pseudo-labels at the connectivity level, which makes it easier to locate
and correct closed and open set noise. Specifically, SeCo comprises two key com-
ponents: Pixel Semantic Aggregation (PSA) and Semantic Connectivity Correction
(SCC). Initially, PSA categorizes semantics into “stuff” and “things” categories
and aggregates speckled pseudo-labels into semantic connectivity through efficient
interaction with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). This enables us not only
to obtain accurate boundaries but also simplifies noise localization. Subsequently,
SCC introduces a simple connectivity classification task, which enables us to locate
and correct connectivity noise with the guidance of loss distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SeCo can be flexibly applied to various cross-domain
semantic segmentation tasks, i.e. domain generalization and domain adaptation,
even including source-free, and black-box domain adaptation, significantly improv-
ing the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Introduction

Propelled by deep neural networks, remarkable strides have been achieved in semantic segmentation
technology [8, 10, 80, 31]. However, deep segmentation models encounter a significant decline in
adaptability when confronted with open domains. This challenge is mainly attributed to the inherent
domain shift between the training and testing data [22, 9, 13]. To address cross-domain challenges,
Domain Adaptation (DA) [21] and Domain Generalization (DG) [11] techniques have been proposed
to enhance the segmenter’s adaptability to the target domain or unseen domains.

Pseudo-labeling [67] is a widely used technique in cross-domain semantic segmentation tasks,
enhancing model efficiency by training with pixels assigned reliable pseudo-labels. The core of

method effectively filters out and corrects closed-set noise (the orange box) induced by domain shifts,
as well as open-set noise (the cyan box) in the wild data (e.g., synthesized from stable diffusion [64]).

pseudo-labeling is how to eliminate semantic noise. In the DA task, various works are dedicated
to designing efficient selection or training methods, such as multi-classifier voting [97, 90] or
augmentation consistency [2, 26] principles to stabilize noisy training. Furthermore, in the DG task,
advanced work [4] has also shown that pseudo-labeling can be used to leverage in-the-wild data
synthesized by stable diffusion, enhancing the segmenter’s generalization to unseen domains.

Despite the significant advancements made by these methods, we have identified limitations in the
pseudo-labels as depicted in Fig. 1. Firstly, under relatively severe domain shifts, most selected
reliable pixels appear speckled and remain noisy. (the orange box). Secondly, when dealing with
in-the-wild data, pixels belonging to the open-set class may also be selected as ‘reliable’ and still
exhibit speckle (the cyan box). These make it difficult for the selection mechanism to identify and
correct these speckled close- and open-set noises. As a result, speckle noise labels with open-set
or closed-set noise are introduced into the subsequent self-training process, leading to severe error
accumulation. These issues indicate that constructing pixel-level uncertainty measures to filter noisy
pseudo-labels is very challenging, especially in open environments.

Segment Anything Model (SAM) [37] is a foundation segmentation model that takes both images
and geometric prompts (points, boxes, masks) as input and outputs class-agnostic masks. Motivated
by this, some attempts [4, 5] have been made to adopt SAM to refine the pseudo-labels. For instance,
using reliable pixel pseudo-labels to prompt SAM to generate class-agnostic masks, and then assigning
pseudo-classes to these masks. However, due to inappropriate prompting and semantic noise, these
attempts may not improve the quality of pseudo-labels and even exacerbate their semantic noise, as
shown in Fig. 1(c).

In this paper, we introduce a novel method called Semantic Connectivity-driven Pseudo-labeling
(SeCo) for cross-domain semantic segmentation. SeCo models the distribution of pseudo-label noise
at the connectivity level, allowing for effective correction of closed-set noise and removal of open-set
noise. SeCo comprises two key components: Pixel Semantic Aggregation (PSA) and Semantic
Connectivity Correction (SCC). Initially, PSA splits the categories into the “stuff” and “things” forms.
Then, PSA efficiently aggregates speckled pseudo-labels into semantic connectivity 2 by interacting
with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). This strategy not only ensures precise boundaries but
also streamlines noise localization, as distinguishing noise at the connectivity level is inherently
more straightforward than at the pixel level. Subsequently, SCC introduces a sample connectivity
classification task for learning connectivity with noisy labels. As connectivity classification focuses
on local overall categories, we propose to leverage the technique of early learning in noisy label

2We refer to the concept of “connected components” in traditional image processing [30], and call the
connected regions here as “semantic connectivity”.

learning [88, 45] to identify connectivity noise, guided by loss distribution. As illustrated in Fig. 1(d),
the incorporation of the proposed connectivity-driven pseudo-labels significantly enhances the quality
of pseudo-labels, showcasing complete structures and reduced close- and open-set category noise.

In summary, the contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we identify the drawbacks of the
pseudo-labeling technique and highlight the significance of semantic connectivity in addressing
these challenges. Second, we propose a Semantic Connectivity-driven pseudo-labeling (SeCo)
algorithm, which can effectively generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby facilitating robust
domain adaptation. Third, extensive experiments underscore the versatility of SeCo in effectively
addressing various cross-domain semantic segmentation tasks, including domain generalization,
traditional, even source-free [38, 28], and black-box [89] domain adaptation. Notably, SeCo achieves
marked enhancements in the more challenging source-free and black-box domain adaptation tasks.

Method

Problem Definition. Cross-domain semantic segmentation aims to transfer a segmentor trained on
the labeled source domain Ds = {(xi
s, yi
s)}Is
i=1 to the unlabeled target domain Dt = {(xi
t)}It
i=1,
where Is and It indicate the number of samples for each domain respectively. x and y represent
an image and corresponding ground-truth label. Presently, mainstream cross-domain segmentation
methods optimize the following objective to enhance model adaptability,

L = Ls(xs, ys) + βLt(xt, ˆyt),
(1)

where Ls is the supervised cross-entropy loss, β is the trade-off weight, Lt is the unsupervised
pseudo-labeling loss, and ˆyt is the pseudo-label. This formula underscores the critical importance of
the quality of pseudo-labels in improving the model’s cross-domain ability. To alleviate the noise in
pseudo-labels, various estimation [97, 3] and calibration [73, 7, 42, 79] methods have been introduced
for pseudo-label selection. However, as mentioned above, the filtered pseudo-labels still encounter
issues of constrained semantics and challenging localization of category noise.

2.1
Overview

The presented Semantic Connectivity-driven pseudo-labeling (SeCo) is illustrated in Fig. 2. SeCo
comprises two components, namely Pixel Semantic Aggregation (PSA) and Semantic Connectivity
Correction (SCC), working collaboratively to refine the low-quality and noisy pseudo-labels into
high-quality and clean pseudo-labels. Initially, PSA aggregates pixels from the filtered pseudo-labels
into connections by interacting with the segment anything model (SAM) [36] through stuff and
things interactions. Subsequently, PSA segments the image into multiple connectivities based on
their semantics. Guided by the connectivity set, SCC establishes a connectivity classifier, conducts

connectivity pooling on image features, and classifies each connectivity. Leveraging information about
fitting difficulty and loss distribution, SCC identifies and corrects noise. Finally, the connectivity-
driven pseudo-labels, characterized by comprehensive semantics and low noise are achieved.

2.2
Pixel Semantic Aggregation

Motivation: Why SAM? Pixel semantic aggregation (PSA) proposes utilizing reliable pixels within
pseudo-labels as category references and subsequently aggregating pixels that share similar semantics
into connections. Intuitively, the above goals can be achieved through interactive segmentation
[66, 44, 62] or pixel clustering [55, 1], but traditional techniques often struggle to accurately identify
semantic boundaries in complex scenes, resulting in ambiguous aggregation. The advent interactive
segmentation model, segment anything model (SAM) [36], provides powerful semantic capture
capabilities. With reasonable prompts, SAM has the potential to give accurate semantic boundaries
even in complex scenes [47, 33]. Building on SAM’s remarkable capability, we are motivated to
investigate how to leverage the reliable yet limited pseudo-labels to prompt SAM effectively and
enhance the completion of pseudo-label semantics.

Discussion on Utilization of SAM. We analyze two naive solutions as outlined below. The first
involves sampling the center pixels of each connected region on the pseudo-label as prompt points, as
depicted in Fig. 3(a). We observe that when prompt points of the same category contain noise, this
method compromises the aggregated segmentation structure. The disruption is attributed to noisy
prompts interfering with the cross-attention mechanism in SAM [36].

The second method represents an improved way, called semantic alignment [5], aligning pseudo-
labels with the connectivity established by SAM. This involves selecting the pseudo-label with the
maximum proportion in each connectivity as the category for the entire region, as illustrated in Fig. 3
(b). We note that while this approach can refine pseudo-labels, it is consistently influenced by SAM’s
uncertain semantic granularity, particularly in the context of neighboring instance objects. Fig. 3
(b) provides examples of failures in this method, where SAM aggregates two categories, “traffic
sign” and “pole” into a semantic connected region, leading to misaligned pseudo-labels due to this
uncertainty. Our analysis indicates that this issue arises because SAM constructs connectivity by
uniformly sampling points in space as prompts and subsequently filtering out redundantly connected
regions. This fails to ensure corresponding sampling points for neighboring instance objects, resulting
in a semantic granularity deviation between SAM’s connectivity and specific segmentation tasks.

In summary, “prompts” interaction can aid in determining semantic granularity but is vulnerable
to noise; Conversely, “alignment” interaction can alleviate noise interference but is susceptible to
uncertain semantic granularity. Hence, implementing SAM in cross-domain segmentation is a
considerable challenge without a thoughtful design. (For more discussion about SAM, see Sec.3.2)

Our Strategy. Building upon the analysis above, we find that noise significantly affects “stuff”
categories due to their larger size and higher pixel proportions, making them more prone to selecting
noisy pixels. On the other hand, semantic granularity uncertainty is more prevalent in “things”
categories, given their smaller size and dense adjacency. To this end, we propose to interact with
SAM in the form of “stuff” and “thing”. Specifically, for “stuff”, we utilize semantic alignment to
mitigate the impact of noisy prompts, while for “things”, we employ box and point prompts to guide
the semantic precision. The detailed algorithm is in Algorithm 1. An illustration of the proposed
strategy is shown in Fig. 3(c).

tasks. By establishing a bi-modal Gaussian function, noisy connectivity can be effectively located.

2.3
Semantic Connectivity Correction
PSA aggregates both precise and noisy pseudo-labels into connectivities, facilitating the locating and
correction of noise. This simplicity arises from the fact that distinguishing noise at the connectivity
level is much easier than at the pixel level, as it eliminates the necessity to scrutinize local semantics
and instead focuses on the overall category (See experimental analysis in Appendix D).

Inspired by this, we propose Semantic Connectivity Correction (SCC), introducing a simple con-
nectivity classification task and detecting noise through loss distribution. Specifically, given the
input image xi, we first obtain the connectivity mask list M = {mi,n}Ni
n=1 and its corresponding
connectivity-level pseudo-label ˆysc = {ˆyi,n
sc }Ni
n=1 from PSA, where Ni represents the number of
connectivities for the i-th sample xi. Then, we set up a connectivity classifier, comprising a feature
extractor Fscc and a linear layer MLP, and optimize it with the following objective,

Lscc =
X

i,k,n
−ˆyi,n,k
sc
log(MLP(Pool[Fscc(xi), mi,n])).
(2)

Pool[·, mask] denotes the average pooling of features corresponding to the input mask, k ∈[0, 1, ...K],
and K is the category number. Optimizing Lscc conducts a K-way classification for each connectivity
with clean and noisy labels.

Based on observations of early learning in noisy learning[88, 45, 82]: when training on noisy labels,
deep neural networks, in the early stages of learning, initially match the training data with clean
labels, and subsequently memorize examples with erroneous labels. We warm up the connectivity
classifier for several epochs and then obtain the loss distribution by calculating Eq. (2) for each
connectivity. As shown in Fig. 4, the loss of connectivities presents bimodol distribution, and the
clusters with larger losses correspond to higher noise, which better conforms to the observations.
To this end, we employ a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model to effectively model the loss
distribution using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm [82]. Subsequently, the probability of
connectivity being noisy, denoted as η, can be reasonably approximated by the Gaussian distribution
associated with bigger loss, i.e., ηi,n = p(c|Lscc(x, mi,n)). c is the parameters of the corresponding
Gaussian distribution. We keep the clean connectivity by setting a noise threthod τns, i.e.,

Dclean = {(xi, yi,n
sc )|ηi,n < τns}.
(3)

Besides, we find that many noisy connectivities can be corrected by setting another correction
threshold τcr on the output probability of connectivity classifier, i.e.,

Dcorr = {(xi, k)|pi,n,k
scc
> τcr, ηi,n > τns},
(4)

where pn,k
scc represents the probability of class k for the n-th connectivity. We take the union of the
two sets as the final connectivity-driven pseudo-label set Dall = Dclean ∪Dcorr for self-training.

2.4
Implementation on Domain Adaptation & Generalization Tasks
We provide solutions on connectivity-driven pseudo-labels for different domain adaptation tasks.

Domain Generalization(DG). Following [4], we first use Stable Diffusion to synthesize simulated
unseen domain data. Then, we use the DG model and our SeCo to pseudo-label these synthesized
data and retrain the DG model on them.

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation. The connectivity-driven pseudo-label set Dall serves two
primary functions. Firstly, they contribute to the pseudo-labeling Lt loss in Eq. (1), providing

5

accurate semantic guidance for the target domain. The second objective is to mitigate category bias
in domain adaptation. We treat Dall as a sample pool, where we resample minority classes in the
target domain and duplicate them through copy-paste operation [16] onto both domains.

Source-free & Black-box Domain Adaptation. In these scenarios, source access is restricted.
This limitation prevents the deployment of the source loss Ls in Eq. (1), making self-training more
vulnerable to noise interference. Connectivity-driven pseudo-label set Dall brings a novel idea to
mitigate these challenges. With its contribution to accurate semantics and low noise, Dall can be
viewed as a well-organized labeled set, thereby transforming source-free and black-box domain
adaptation tasks into semi-supervised segmentation tasks[84, 83].

Discussion about Fair Comparison. We acknowledge the potential concern regarding unfair
comparisons between our SAM-incorporating method and existing approaches. First, it is important
to emphasize the considerable challenges in applying SAM to CDSS tasks. Detailed experiments
are in Table 5 of Section 3.2. We believe our work makes a significant contribution to exploring the
potential of SAM-enhanced CDSS tasks. Second, our method is designed to be integrative, enhancing
existing pseudo-labeling methods rather than competing with them (as demonstrated in Section 3.1
and Tables 1 and 2). Third, we conducted experiments without using SAM to validate that the
proposed semantic connectivity denoising idea still has advantages, as shown in Fig. 5 of Section 3.2.
We hope this work can inspire the community to further investigate the effective utilization of SAM
in CDSS, embracing the popular trend of facilitating visual tasks with large-scale models, such as
enhancing classification [52, 81, 61] with large-language models (e.g., GPT-3).

Experiments

Datasets. We employ two real datasets (Cityscapes [12] and BDD-100k [86]) alongside two synthetic
datasets (GTA5 [63] and SYNTHIA [65]). The details of these datasets are introduced in Section B.

Implementation Details. Traditional UDA: We opted for two network architectures: DeepLabV2 [6]
with ResNet-101 [19] and SegFormer [80] with MiT-B5. For DeepLabV2, we chose two classical
methods, AdvEnt [70] and ProDA [90], as the baselines. For SegFormer, we selected two highly
successful UDA methods, DAFormer [24] and HRDA [25], as the baselines. Source-free UDA:
We maintain DeepLabV2 as the base network to align with existing works. We chose HCL [28]
and the current SOTA method DTST [93] as baselines. Black-box UDA: We use two SOTA black-
box UDA methods, DINE [43] and BiMem [89], as baselines. Across all tasks, for each baseline
method, we select the pseudo-labels of its predicted top 50% confidence-ranked pixels for SeCo
processing. Subsequently, we utilize the SAM [36] with Vision Transformer-H (ViT-H) [14] to
generate connectivities. We refrain from using SAM to refine pseudo-labels for test data to avoid
introducing extra inference overhead. The automatic mask generation process in SAM adheres to the
official parameter settings. In Algorithm 1, the enlargement factor for the bounding box area is set to
1.5. The connectivity classifier is trained only for 5000 iterations in an early learning way for all tasks.
The noise threshold (τns) and correction threshold (τcr) are configured at 0.60 and 0.95, respectively.

3.1
Combined SeCO with State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Methods

The performance of SeCo is shown in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4. Overall, experimental results indicate that
SeCo can be integrated with various SOTA domain adaptation and domain generalization methods,
and significantly enhances their adaptability. Moreover, SeCo exhibits notable improvements for both
source-free and black-box adaptation, overcoming limitations with the source domain data.

Domain Generalization. In this experiment, we followed CLOUDS [4], which uses synthetic data
from Stable Diffusion (SD) to assist DG. Our aims are: 1) to show that our method can handle
challenging synthesized data with open-set noise, and 2) to compare our SAM usage with the
competitive scheme in CLOUDS. Compared to the DG baseline SHADE and HRDA, our method
significantly improves their performance by 6.8% and 3.1%, respectively. Compared to CLOUDS,
which also uses SAM, we achieve even greater improvements, further enhancing performance by
1.4% and 1.0%.

Domain Adaptation. GTA5 →Cityscapes. Results are reported in Table 1. In the UDA setting,
the integration of SeCo with AdvEnt [70] leads to a notable performance improvement, achieving
a 13.4% increase in mIoU score. Combining SeCo with ProDA [90] results in a 9.4% increase in

Table 4: The comparison of performance in terms of mIoU score (%) on the Open Compoud domain
adaptation task between SeCo (ours) and other state-of-the-art methods.

Domain Semantic Segmentation (CDSS) can hardly obtain improvement.
1⃝Use the backbone of
SAM to empower CDSS. Table 5 shows that utilizing SAM as the backbone achieves a notable
performance drop in UDA. The reduction mainly came from rare classes (e.g. “train” and “truck”).
Both DAFomer and HRDA use Feature Distance to keep the semantic knowledge of ViT-B pre-trained
on ImageNet, effectively improving the adaptation for rare classes. However, SAM’s pre-training
does not consider such semantic knowledge and thus obtains inferior results in rare classes.
2⃝Is the
UDA still necessary, if we use CLIP+SAM (CSAM) to get the initial pseudo label? We conduct the
following experiment to explore the feasibility of CLIP+SAM: a) Use SAM to segment the input
image. b) Extract the largest bounding rectangle from each segment. c) Create text descriptions for
categories, e.g., "a photo of a road." d) Use CLIP to match image patches with text descriptions,
assigning text labels as categories. CLIP+SAM+UDA combines pseudo-labels from CLIP+SAM and
UDA, using voting fusion to select consistent predictions for training. Table 5 shows that CSAM
cannot obtain competitive results on the target data, even when combined with UDA methods.
The reasons are below. Given spatially uniform sampling as prompt points, 1) SAM is prone to
over-segmentation results, which makes it difficult for CLIP to obtain sufficient context from small
segments. 2) SAM’s segments may conflict with the defined semantics of the target data, e.g., SAM
always treats ’poles’ and ’traffic sign’ as one segment.
3⃝Is using SAM on coarse pseudo-labels
enough? Table 5 shows the comparison of using vanilla SAM and our method on the source-trained
model’s (Coarse) and UDA-adapted model’s prediction. It shows that the gains of using SAM on
coarse pseudo-labels are minimal and even negative on strong UDA baselines. This is because
SAM risks introducing more semantic noise when extending semantic boundaries. Our method,
even with coarse pseudo-labels, allows SAM to achieve greater benefits. The above discussions
indicate the difficulty of applying SAM in cross-domain segmentation and the non-trivial design of
our SAM-based method.

Is Our Method Specific to SAM? The proposed Semantic Connectivity Correction (SCC) is general
and not specific to SAM. SCC can work on any form of pseudo-labels, although their connectivity
structure may not be as good as SAM’s. In Fig. 5, we report the results of directly using SCC on
pseudo-labels generated by existing UDA models. Under this exact fair comparison, our method still
achieves good improvement and is more competitive than widely used Knowledge Distillation (KD)
[90]. Again, we want to emphasize that this work aims to bring a new perspective for enhancing
CDSS to embrace the huge benefit of large-scale models, which is a non-trivial contribution.

task. PSA: Pixel Semantic Aggregation. SCC: Semantic Connectivity Correction. PSA(b) refers to
the interaction with SAM using semantic alignment [5], as shown in Fig. 3. SF-UDA: source-free
UDA. BB-UDA: black-box UDA.

Ablation Study. The results of ablation experiments are presented in Table 6. We conduct analyses
across different domain adaptation settings as follows.

In UDA, PSA yields a performance improvement of 5.4% for ProDA [90], surpassing the gains
achieved by PSA(b). Additionally, SCC builds upon PSA, contributing an additional 5.0% enhance-
ment to ProDA. A similar trend is observed in the ablation study on DAFormer [24]. These findings
suggest that, at the interaction level with SAM, PSA proves more effective than PSA(b); however,
interacting solely with SAM is insufficient for achieving substantial self-training performance gains.
SCC plays a crucial role in further filtering out noise propagated by SAM, leading to a significant
enhancement in UDA performance.

In source-free UDA, PSA results in a 3.0% performance improvement for DTST [93], still outper-
forming PSA(b). Due to the substantial initial pseudo-label noise in the source-free setting, PSA
aggregates more noisy connections, resulting in a diminished performance gain compared to UDA.
SCC, building upon PSA, brings an improvement of 5.4%, reinforcing the notion that SCC can
effectively filter and correct propagated pseudo-labels.

In balck-box UDA, PSA brings a marginal improvement, with only a gain of 1.2%. SCC on top of
PSA achieves a substantial improvement of 7.3%, further confirming the aforementioned conclusions.
These results underscore the importance of correcting noise within connections, especially under
more significant domain shifts and weaker initial segmentation results.

Table 8: Detailed comparison of our SCC and Dividemix across multiple domain adaptation tasks.

Detailed ablation on prompt way. We conduct ablation studies on "Prompting Only" (PO) and
"Semantic Alignment"(SA) across multiple tasks in GTA →Cityscape in Table 7. We provide two
metrics for these detailed ablations: PL mIoU (pseudo-label quality on the training set) and Val.
mIoU (model performance on the validation set after training with those pseudo-labels). As shown
in the Table 7, the "prompting only" method reduces the quality of pseudo-labels in the training set,
leading to poor adaptation performance. This is because the unreliable interaction method introduces
excessive noise into the pseudo-labels generated by SAM. "Semantic alignment" improves the quality
of the training set pseudo-labels, but the improvement is limited, resulting in limited adaptation
benefits. In contrast, our method enhances the quality of the training set pseudo-labels through better
interaction, leading to superior performance gains.

Ablation studies on our SCC and Dividemix. Our SCC is partly inspired by DivideMix[41],
however, we focus on mitigating the pixel-level noises in pseudo-labels raised by domain shifts and
SAM refinement, while Dividemix focuses on mitigating the image-level label noises. Besides, we
would like to emphasize that one of the main contributions of SCC is to provide the idea of denoising
at the connectivity level, which makes it possible to apply other image-level denoising methods
such as Dividemix to segmentation tasks. To better verify the effectiveness of our SCC, we make
two experiments as show in Table 8: a) directly applying DivideMix to pixel-level denoising. b)
using DivideMix to denoise the pixels aggregated by our PSA (using SAM). The results show that
pixel-level denoising methods based on DivideMix are inferior to SCC even with SAM, highlighting
the advantage of denoising at the connectivity level.

Conclusion

In this work, we propose Semantic Connectivity-driven Pseudo-labeling (SeCo), formulating pseudo-
labels at the connectivity level for structured and low-noise semantics. SeCo, comprising Pixel
Semantic Aggregation (PSA) and Semantic Connectivity Correction (SCC), efficiently aggregates
speckled pseudo-labels into semantic connectivity with SAM. SCC introduces a simple connectivity
classification task for locating and correcting connected noise. Experiments demonstrate SeCo’s flexi-
bility and significant effectiveness in performance across various cross-domain semantic segmentation
tasks. We hope that this work could inspire the community to apply SAM to more cross-domain,
semi-supervised and few-shot segmentation settings.

Related Work

Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (DASS) transfers the source knowledge to the target
mainly through the following avenues: Source Domain Augmentation: This approach involves
employing style augmentation [85, 27, 96, 40] and domain randomization [17, 87, 34, 29, 20] to
expand the representation space learned by the source domain model with limited data, thereby
enhancing the model’s generalization capability. Minority Class Enhancement: This line of work
introduces minority class resampling [68, 16, 93, 49], minority class perturbation [75, 50], and
minority class feature alignment [48] to enhance the adaptation capability of minority classes.
Aligning Source and Target Domains: This line of work employ various domain alignment strategies,
e.g., adversarial training [23, 72], statistical matching [76], across diverse alignment spaces (e.g., input
[21, 71], feature [72] and output space [69]) to reduce statistical differences between the two domains.
Self-Training Techniques: This line of methods primarily employs pseudo-labeling techniques to
further address the issue of inadequate target adaptation. To counter pseudo-label noise, existing
approaches employ various strategies, including introducing strong augmentations from input data
[26], designing teacher-student model structures [25], and employing pseudo-label selection methods
[3, 42, 57, 98, 99, 51, 94, 74], alleviating the issue of error accumulation. Our work is the first to
formulate pseudo-labels at the connectivity level, thereby facilitating the learning of structured and
low-noise semantics.

Domain Generalizable Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is proposed to address the generalization
problem to unseen domains, which is more realistic as we often cannot obtain target data in advance.
In the computer vision field, existing DGSS methods usually regard style information as a domain
factor and remove it or augment it explicitly to achieve generalization. For example, some advanced
methods remove style-related factors by specific normalization [58] or whitening [11] operations.
Another type of method attempts to expand the generalization boundary of the model by expanding
diverse style data in global [87, 27] or class level [59]. However, style augmentation alone in the
domain fails to enable the model to cover more unseen scenarios. Cloud [4] proposes leveraging the
pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to simulate synthetic scenarios and uses SAM to complete their
pseudo-labels, which further significantly improves the generalization of the model. Following this
approach, our method can further filter out the label noise caused by utilizing SAM in the cloud.

Segment Anything Model (SAM) [36] has gained widespread attention, with multiple works
incorporating it into specific segmentation tasks. For instance, [47] fine-tuned SAM in the medical
domain to establish a robust foundational medical model. In few-shot learning, [91] applied SAM,
achieving notable results with minimal parameter fine-tuning. [77] proposed an efficient method
for fine-tuning SAM in downstream segmentation scenarios. Moreover, [5] combined SAM with
semantic segmentation models to enhance segmentation model boundaries. Our approach signals the
strong potential of SAM in pseudo-label-based cross-domain segmentation tasks. While [5] is closely
related, we conduct a detailed analysis of its limitations in Section 2.2.

Noisy Label Learning (NLL). Currently, NLL focuses on classification tasks with techniques like
robust loss design [92], regularization [78], label weighting [60], and correction [41]. These methods
typically target image-level noise and may not be effective for pixel-level segmentation, which
involves complex spatial and semantic dependencies among pixels. Maintaining spatial consistency
across millions of pixels is a challenge for current image-level denoising methods. In segmentation,
few methods focus on denoising the pseudo-label, such as ProDA and RPL, which denoise each
pixel independently and still face the challenges highlighted in our paper. Our SeCo effectively links
image-level techniques with segmentation tasks, offering novel solutions for pseudo-label denoising
in segmentation.

Futher Results

Hyper-Parameter Sensitivity. Fig. 6 illustrates the impact of τns and τcr on the final model’s
adaptability (mIoU), connectivity accuracy, and the kept number of connectivity. We set the range of
τns from 0.2 to 0.8 to balance excessive connectivity filtering for small values and noise persistence
for large values. τcr is maintained within a confidence threshold range of 0.85 to 0.99 to avoid error
correction issues. It can be observed that within a specific range, the influence of τns and τcr on
the final model’s adaptability is minimal. Regarding τns: a larger τns retains more connectivity
but introduces more noise, leading to a decrease in adaptability. A smaller τns maintains higher
connectivity accuracy, but a lower quantity reduces richness and results in a decrease in mIoU.
Regarding τcr: a larger τcr corrects some confident connections, improving accuracy and adaptability.
A smaller τcr introduces more noise, compromising accuracy and adaptability. The final τns / τcr is
set to 0.6 / 0.95.

Why is it easier to filter noise at the connectivity level than at the pixel level? We find that
compared to pixel-level classification, connectivity-level classifiers can more easily construct a
compact feature space, thus simplifying noise filtering. As shown in Fig. 7, we measure the distance
from features to class cluster centers (introduced as the “FID” metric in [72]) for ADVENT, ProDA,

DAFormer, and our method after adaptation. We use the FID value for each category in the ADVENT
method as the baseline, and normalize the FID values of other methods by dividing them by this
baseline. Therefore, the FID values for all categories in ADVENT are set to 1. A smaller FID
value indicates a more compact cluster and better feature separability. The results indicate that our
connectivity-level classifier significantly enhances feature separability.

E
More diverse scenes

We explore SeCo’s performance in more segmentation scenarios, including indoor scenes, cross-
domain medical images, and cross-domain remote sensing images, as shown in Table 9 - Table 11.
Based on these positive experimental results, we believe SeCo has the potential to be integrated into
more segmentation scenarios involving the use of unlabeled data.

Indoor scenes: The commonly used segmentation dataset for indoor scenes is ADE20K, but no
cross-domain segmentation benchmark exists. Thus, we conduct experiments on a semi-supervised
segmentation task, which also involves utilizing pseudo-labels from unlabeled data (domain adaptation
is seen as semi-supervised learning with domain shift). We perform PSA using the stuff and thing
definitions in ADE20K and execute SCC with default parameters. We use the Unimatch model
as the baseline and follow its settings. The results of incorporating SeCo are shown in the table
below. In multiple labeled data splits (1/64 - 1/8) in ADE20K, SeCo shows significant performance
improvement compared to directly using SAM.

Medical images: We follow the medical image UDA setup from Sim-T[3], using the Endovis17
and Endovis18 abdominal surgery datasets collected from different devices containing 3 instrument
type classes. We treat the segmentation objects as "things" and aggregate pixels using only boxes
and points from the pseudo-label. The table below shows how SeCo greatly benefits SAM in this
challenging task.

Remote sensing: We follow the UDA setup in remote sensing from the CIA[4], using the Potsdam
and Vaihingen datasets collected from different satellites. These datasets contain five common
semantic categories: car, tree, impervious surface, building, and low vegetation. We treat cars and
buildings as "things," and the rest as "stuff." The table below shows that SeCo still achieves significant
performance improvement compared to directly using SAM.

Visualization

Fig. 8 displays the pseudo-label outputs of PSA and SCC in the GTA5 →BDD-100K task. In this
open compound adaptation task, the model’s initial speckled pseudo-labels exhibit considerable
noise. It is noticeable that PSA aggregates speckle noise into connected components, concurrently
amplifying noisy pseudo-labels. Subsequently, SCC further suppresses and corrects the connected
noise from PSA, leading to more structured and lower-noise pseudo-labels. This further validates the
motivation behind the design of PSA and SCC.

Fig. 9 demonstrates that SeCo has the potential to filter out noisy semantic connectivity when faced
with domain shifts in various domain environments. Compared to directly using SAM to complete
pseudo-labels, SeCo provides a safer and more efficient approach, to some extent avoiding the
problem of error accumulation in self-training.

Fig. 10 shows that for unseen domain environments simulated by Stable Diffusion, the pseudo-labels
generated by basic domain generalization methods are very noisy and chaotic. In such cases, filtering
at the pixel level is more challenging. As seen in (b), pixel-level filtering functions struggle to
eliminate both closed-set and open-set noise. As seen in (c), directly using SAM to complete pseudo-
labels easily leads to the propagation of noise. (d) shows that our SeCo has the potential to filter out
some of the noisy labels in such wild data.

G
Limitations

While our SeCo can integrate existing domain adaptation and domain generalization methods, it
lacks an explicitly designed category-balanced connectivity noise filtering method. Additionally,
the results demonstrate that SeCo can identify open-set noise in outdoor data. However, due to the
current evaluation environment limitations, we cannot directly evaluate its effectiveness. In the future,
SeCo is expected to incorporate more visual foundational models to enhance pseudo-labeling for
outdoor data targeting unknown distributions.

H
Broader Impacts

SeCo aims to enhance the adaptability of segmentation to unseen domains or target domains, and
has the potential to be applied in open-world scenarios. It has the potential to be combined with

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We emphasized in the abstract and introduction that the main scope of our work
is to use connected denoising technology to enhance the expressive ability of cross-domain
segmentation.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer the Sec. G.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

23


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We elaborate on the implementation details and submit the code in the supple-
mentary material.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

24


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have submitted the code in the supplementary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We describe the details in Sec. A and illustrate the implementation in code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer Sec. 3.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

25


---Page Break---
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer Sec. 3.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We make sure to preserve anonymity and with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer Sec. H.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

26


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

27


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide a detailed description of the submitted code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
