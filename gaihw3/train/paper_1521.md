Abstract

Transformer-based diffusion models have achieved significant advancements across
a variety of generative tasks. However, producing high-quality outputs typically
necessitates large transformer models, which result in substantial training and
inference overhead. In this work, we investigate an alternative approach involving
multiple experts for denoising, and introduce Remix-DiT, a novel method designed
to enhance output quality at a low cost. The goal of Remix-DiT is to craft N diffu-
sion experts for different denoising timesteps, yet without the need for expensive
training of N independent models. To achieve this, Remix-DiT employs K basis
models (where K < N) and utilizes learnable mixing coefficients to adaptively
craft expert models. This design offers two significant advantages: first, although
the total model size is increased, the model produced by the mixing operation
shares the same architecture as a plain model, making the overall model as efficient
as a standard diffusion transformer. Second, the learnable mixing adaptively allo-
cates model capacity across timesteps, thereby effectively improving generation
quality. Experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that Remix-
DiT achieves promising results compared to standard diffusion transformers and
other multiple-expert methods.

Introduction

Transformer-based Diffusion models [39, 8, 29, 2] have shown significant potential in generating
high-quality images and videos [24, 20, 3]. However, achieving such quality often requires large
transformer architectures [35], which incur considerable training and inference costs. To alleviate
these computational burdens, multi-expert denoising has emerged as a promising approach [1, 18,
28, 16, 27], which employs multiple specialized diffusion models, each designed for distinct time
intervals within the denoising process.

The goal of multi-expert denoising is to increase the overall capacity of diffusion models while
keeping an acceptable overhead. The denoising process of diffusion models involves multiple
different timesteps [13, 32, 18], requiring the network to make predictions at various noise levels.
Previous work has shown that the tasks of diffusion models vary across different timesteps [13, 37, 27].
For instance, at higher noise levels, the model focuses more on low-frequency features, while at lower
noise levels, the model emphasizes generating high-frequency details [37]. This variability inherently
leads to a multi-task problem [16, 18]. However, due to the limited capacity of a single diffusion
model, it is challenging to craft a comprehensive and balanced model that performs well across the
entire denoising process. To alleviate this issue, multiple-expert denoising deploys specialized expert
models at different timesteps. To this end, each model only needs to learn the denoising task for
a specific subset of timesteps. Although this design introduces multiple models, only one model

is activated at each timestep during the inference process, and therefore the overall computational
complexity does not increase significantly.

In a multi-step denoising process, such as a 1000-step denoising chain, determining the optimal
number of intervals and their partitioning remains an open problem. Existing approaches typically
employ an even-split strategy, which distributes the denoising process equally among a predefined
number of expert models. This uniform allocation often leads to suboptimal utilization of model
capacity. In addition, the training of multiple expert models introduces substantial computational
costs. Due to the inherent task similarity between adjacent intervals in the denoising process, training
separate experts without accounting for this similarity can result in redundant and inefficient training.
Although some recent methodologies, such as tree-structured training [1], have proposed hierarchical
strategies to mitigate these issues, the process of training and capacity allocation remains largely
manual and heuristic. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel, learnable strategy to
craft multiple experts adaptively for denoising.

Consider a denoising process of T steps. The objective of this paper is to construct N expert models,
each handling an interval of length T

N as shown in Figure 1 (b). A straightforward approach to improve
performance is to increase the number of experts, as more experts provide greater total capacity,
leading to enhanced performance. However, this also results in a linear increase in training costs. The
core idea of the proposed method lies in training only K(K < N) basis models, which can be used
to craft N expert models efficiently for inference. To be exact, we construct K transformer-based
diffusion models and introduce learnable mixing coefficients to fuse their parameters, which can be
easily implemented as an embedding layer. During training, the coefficients will learn to allocate the
model capacity across different timesteps. During inference, we precompute those mixed models to
do a chained multi-expert denoising.

We validated the effectiveness of our method on ImageNet-256x256 [6]. Owning to the learnable
nature of Remix-DiT, our approach adaptively allocates model capacity across timesteps, thereby
achieving superior generation results compared to independently trained multiple expert models. Our
analysis of the learned mixing coefficients revealed several insightful findings: Firstly, the coefficients
exhibit a natural similarity between adjacent timesteps, indicating that tasks at neighboring steps
are relatively similar. Conversely, the coefficients for timesteps that are further apart show distinct
differences, supporting the multi-expert denoising hypothesis that the learning target at different
steps can be quite diverged. Additionally, our method’s learnable coefficients tend to allocate more
capacity to early timesteps, suggesting that the algorithm identifies predictions at lower noise levels
as more challenging and thus requires greater capacity to generate finer details. In contrast, at higher
noise levels (i.e., timesteps approaching T), the algorithm integrates multiple basis models for higher
utilization of model capacity. Furthermore, we observed that experts created through hybridization
exhibit specialization, achieving lower loss at specific timesteps while incurring higher loss at others.
Through collaborative denoising, such specialization reduces overall prediction errors, highlighting
the effectiveness of our method.

Multiple Experts in Diffusion Models
The multi-step denoising process inherent to the diffusion
model [14, 33, 34] can be viewed as a multitasking problem [1, 18, 28, 16]. At each step, the
model receives inputs with varying levels of noise and makes predictions accordingly. Given the
disparate learning objectives for each denoising step, the utilization of a singular model across all
stages is, to a certain extent, inefficient and challenging. Several prior works suggested employing
multiple models, each dedicated to handling partial timestep intervals. For example, E-Diff [1]
introduces a simple binary strategy to learn various experts and during inference, take the ensemble
of experts for prediction. OMS-DPM [18] proposes a model scheduler, dynamically taking denoiser
of different sizes from a model zoo for inference. MEME [16] deploys a similar paradigm, yet
training lightweight models for different steps. The ensemble of these lightweight denoisers can
achieve superior performance compared to their larger counterparts while maintaining efficiency
during inference. Another exploration to enhance efficiency using multiple experts is T-Stich [27],
which stitches the denoising trajectories of different pre-trained models, enabling dynamic inference
cost without additional training. However, it’s noteworthy that multiple diffusion models may incur
additional storage and context switch costs. Thus, DTR [28] introduces a novel multi-tasking strategy
to learn a single model with scheduled task masks, activating specific sub-networks for different
timesteps.

Transformer-based Diffusion Models
Transformer-based diffusion models have achieved im-
pressive results on image generation [2, 29, 4, 10, 20, 17]. DiT [29] explores the scalability of
transformers for image generation, achieving competitive performance compared to CNN-based
diffusion models. UViT [2] independently explores transformer design for generation, incorporating
the U-Net [31, 22, 30] architecture for improved training efficiency and quality. Furthermore, recent
works have expanded transformer-based diffusion models to video generation [20, 21, 24, 5, 3],
audio [19, 15] and 3D [25] which shows the power of transformers in modeling complicated data.
However, training diffusion models remains inefficient, typically requiring millions of steps to pro-
duce satisfactory results. A series of works in the literature focus on the efficiency of diffusion-based
transformers [40, 40, 23, 9]. MaskDiT [40] and MDTv2 [10] utilize masked transformers and an
additional masked autoencoder task [12] to streamline training. UViT [2] also demonstrates the
benefits of skip connections for accelerating convergence. In this work, we introduce a new strategy
to enhance the training efficiency of plain diffusion transformers

Preliminary

Diffusion Probabilistic Models
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) train a denoiser network
to revert a process of adding gradually increased noises [13]. Given an input x0, a T-step forward
process is deployed to transform x0 into latent x1, . . . xT , where the transformation is defined as
q(xt|xt−1) = N(xt; √1 −βtxt−1, βtI) under a increased variance schedule β1:T . To revert this
process, a network q(xt−1|xt) is trained to predict xt−1 given xt. By defining αt = 1 −βt and
¯αt = Qt
s=1 αs, the training objective is formalized as

L(θ) = Et,x0,ϵ∼N(0,1)

∥ϵ −ϵθ(√¯αtx0 +
√

1 −¯αtϵ, t)∥2
,
(1)

where ϵθ is a trainable neural network and ϵ refer to the noises at timestep t. A common practice in
the literature is to train a single neural network for all timesteps t. However, it has been observed that
the denoising behavior usually varies across timesteps [13, 1, 37, 27]. Due to the limited capacity, a
single model may struggle to fit all steps. Therefore, a more suitable yet natural approach is to use
multiple models specifically learned for different timestep intervals [1]."

Multi-Expert Denoising
To facilitate denoising with N expert models, the timesteps are typically
divided into N intervals. Each model, denoted as ϵθi, contains independent parameters θi. For each
model θi, we minimize the training objective as formalized in Equation 1 on the corresponding

Although the simple form of multi-expert denoising has been verified effective in previous works [1,
16], the above objective still presents two major challenges: 1) The optimal number of experts and
the best interval partition is unknown; 2) Training multiple independent experts can be expensive. In
this work, we introduce a new approach, Remix-DiT to address the above issues.

Method

Uniform Partition of Denoising Process
Let’s consider a multi-expert denoising problem with
N experts for T timesteps. For simplicity, we assume that each expert’s parameters θi is a column
vector with P trainable elements and the parameter matrix of all experts can be formalized as
ΘN×P = [θ1, θ2, · · · , θN]⊤. This is natural since the parameters in a model can be flattened and
concatenated into a vector. We consider a simple partition of timesteps, which equally divides the
denoising process into N intervals, i.e., [0, T/N] ... [(N −1) · T/N, N · T/N]. The motivation
behind the oracle partition is that adjacent steps share similar noise levels and training objectives.
Following Equation 2, this leads to the learning objective to optimize each expert on their associated
time intervals.

The above process involves N independent optimization problem, which presents some issues. First,
the optimal number of experts is unknown. It’s difficult to increase the number of experts since this
will introduce huge training costs. Besides, the optimal partition is also unclear, making the uniform
partition inefficient. In this work, we investigate such a problem: Is it possible to learn any number of
experts, while keeping an affordable overhead?

Crafting Experts by Mixing
To address the problem of uniform partition, we leverage a set of
basis models to avoid straightforward training on experts. The core idea lies in that, it is possible to
fuse the parameters of two diffusion models to achieve better performance [38]. Formally, instead
of training N independent models directly, the core idea of Remix-DiT is to learn K (K < N)
basis models with the same architecture as experts, parameterized by βK×P = [β1, β2, . . . βK]⊤.
And the expert models can be crafted by mixing the basis parameters with certain coefficients. For
each expert θi, we associate it with a coefficients αi = [αi1, αi2, . . . αiK]⊤and compute the mixed
expert parameter through a weighted averaging θi = P

k αikβk. This leads to the coefficient matrix
denoted as αN×K = [α1, α2, . . . , αN]⊤. Then, the expert’s parameter matrix can be easily obtained
through a simple matrix multiplication:

ΘN×P = αN×KβK×P .

With Equation 4, we can freely craft different experts using different mixing coefficients. Now the
problem lies in that how to learn a good coefficients α and basis models β.

Architecture of Remix-DiT
Let’s fur-
ther delve into the details of K basis mod-
els, denoted as β, alongside a coefficients
matrix α. In this study, we adopt the DiT
architecture proposed in [29], which pri-
marily consists of linear and normalization
layers. Rather than constructing K distinct
models, we propose a simple trick to con-
struct a singular and extended DiT model to
encapsulate all K basis models [36]. This
is achieved by increasing the width of the
linear layers by a factor of K, with a modi-
fied forward process to support the mixing
of basis. An example of the extended linear
layer is depicted in Algorithm 1. A notable distinction between the standard DiT and the proposed
Remix-DiT is the integration of a weighted averaging step before the true computation. Despite
the expansion in width by a factor of K, the effective weights engaged during forward propagation
are equivalent to those of a normal DiT of the original width. The additional computational cost is
attributed solely to the element-wise operation during mixing. Furthermore, during the backward
propagation phase, the computational cost of the mixed network almost mirrors those of a standard
DiT, except for the additional overhead caused by the mixing operation.

Network Training
A notable challenge presented by Remix-DiT is the restriction of activating
only one mixed expert during each forwarding and backwarding phase. To address this limitation,
we employ a hierarchical sampling strategy whereby the expert θi is selected first, followed by a
random selection of timestep t within the interval [i × ⌊T

N ⌋, (i + 1) × ⌊T

N ⌋]. Consequently, only one
expert is activated per training step. Despite this constraint, a critical advantage of Remix-DiT is that
regardless of which expert is activated, all basis models remain updatable. This feature distinctly sets
our approach apart from methodologies that train experts independently. The training and inference
processes of Remix-DiT are delineated in Algorithm 2. The training protocol for Remix-DiT closely
mirrors that of a standard DiT, with the exception that the sampled timesteps t must originate from a
singular time interval during each step. During inference, the compact nature of the basis models
allows for reduced GPU memory usage compared to maintaining N separate experts, providing a
significant advantage. Additionally, it is still feasible to pre-compute the N experts for more efficient
inference without runtime mixing.

Transform Pre-trained DiT to Remix-DiT with Prior Coefficients
Training generative models
from scratch is usually inefficient. Note that the proposed method Builds a DiT model with K-times
width. This allows it to inherit the weights of pre-trained DiTs, by replicating the pre-trained weight
K times. This leads to K basis models with the same parameters. However, this will be problematic
if we inspect the gradient to each mixing coefficient, denoted as ∇αi,k:

∇αi,k =
X

k
∇θi ⊙βk,
(5)

where ⊙is an element-wise product of two matrices. First, the update of basis parameter ˆθi is usually
slow, this makes all mixed experts similar to each other at the beginning of training and also makes
the gradient w.r.t the mixed expert ˆθi almost unchanged. In this case, the gradient to the coefficients
will be constant. To address this issue, we introduce a prior regularization to force each basis ˆθi
to learn different objectives. Inspired by the oracle partition in multiple expert denoising, we craft
prior coefficients α∗with one-hot vectors. For example, the hand-coded prior coefficient [0, 1, 0, 0]
directly assigns the second basis as the expert, this encourages a polarization for different bases. And
the regularization can be easily implemented as a cross-entropy between the prior coefficients and the
learnable coefficients.

Experimental Settings

Network Architecture.
This paper utilizes the DiT [29] models as the fundamental architecture.
By reloading the computation process of the linear layers, additional mixing coefficients is introduced
to create RemixDiT. For a fair comparison, we ensure that the dimensions of all mixed experts are
completely consistent with the original DiT. For instance, Remix-DiT-S is constructed by quickly
combining multiple DiT-S models to form an expert model.

Training Details.
Since our mixed model is entirely consistent with the standard DiT, this method
can be applied to pre-trained models. We first trained a standard DiT model on ImageNet and then
initialized the basis model with the same pre-trained weights. We introduce prior as discussed in
Equation 6 to the mixing coefficients to accelerate the learning of different basis models. In our
experiments, we conducted 100 K fine-tuning on DiT-S/B/L models [29], pre-trained for 2M/1M/1M
steps correspondingly.

5.2
Transform Pretrained DiT to Remix-DiT

In Table 1, we present the results of fine-tuning standard DiT models using the Remix-DiT approach.
Given the architectural consistency between the mixed model and the standard DiT, it is feasible
to initialize K basis models within the standard DiT framework. This enables the construction of
RemixDiT with minimal additional training steps since the pre-trained DiT has been comprehensively
trained at all temporal steps. For instance, starting with a pre-trained DiT-B model, our method suc-
cessfully crafts a Remix-B with only 100K training steps, achieving superior performance compared
to both the original models and baselines such as continual training and multiple experts [1].

Moreover, within the same computational budget, our approach outperforms Multi-expert baselines,
where experts are trained independently. It is noteworthy that for Multi-expert baselines with eight
experts, the total training budget is uniformly allocated to each expert. As the number of experts
increases, the allocated training steps for each expert become more limited. In contrast, Remix-
DiT trains shared basis models throughout the entire training process, allowing each model to be
sufficiently updated.

As discussed earlier, RemixDiT allocates gradients from different time steps by employing mixing
coefficients. Therefore, for K basis models initialized similarly, greater diversity in the initial
mixing coefficients facilitates the rapid learning of different models. To achieve this, we sequentially
distribute the entire denoising process among the basis models. During subsequent fine-tuning, the

Figure 3: Comparision to existing methods

To further investigate the behavior of the experts
learned by the algorithm, we visualized the mixing
coefficients. As shown in Figure 4a, we conducted
experiments on DiT-S. During the training of 20 ex-
pert models, we observed that the algorithm assigned
more one-hot coefficients to timesteps close to 0. At
these steps, the denoising model focuses more on
high-frequency detail features. In contrast, at late
timesteps resembling random noise, the algorithm
enabled and mixed multiple models to generate con-
tent rather than using only one expert. As will be
illustrated in Figure 5, mixing multiple models can improve the shape quality. Moreover, it can be
observed that adjacent timesteps exhibit similar mixing coefficients, whereas more distant timesteps
show greater differences. This finding supports the core hypothesis of multi-expert reasoning. To
validate this observation, we further trained a RemixDiT with 8 experts. Figure 4b also shows the
distribution of mixing coefficients, revealing results similar to the previous experiment. Additionally,
Figure 4c visualizes the training loss functions of the 8 expert models throughout the denoising
process. Each mixed expert has a lower loss function within its respective timestep intervals. The
farther from an expert model’s current interval, the higher its loss. Notably, at step 0, we found that
the ensemble-constructed model effectively reduces prediction loss.

5.4
Analytical Experiments

In this section, we validate some key design aspects of RemixDiT. This includes the model’s mixing
method, the number of expert models and basis models, and whether the coefficients are independent
or shared across layers.

Model Mixers.
The core of the proposed method lies in the mixing of multiple models, and we
explored three mixing methods: 1) Oracle Mixing: Basis models are manually assigned to different
intervals as expert models, equivalent to training independent expert models, which makes the
algorithm revert to the standard multi-expert training strategy regardless of N. 2) Raw Mixer: Each
expert is assigned a real-valued coefficient without any constraints. 3) Softmax Mixer: This builds on
the raw mixer by applying a softmax operation, ensuring that the mixed model is always a weighted
average of the basis models. Table 2 shows the effectiveness of each mixer. We found that while
oracle mixing improves model performance, it often fails to achieve optimal results due to manually

Figure 4: (a) Learned Coefficients for a Remix-DiT-S-4-8, which mixes 4 basis DiT-S to obtain
8 models, each associated with a 125-step interval. The x-axis shows the corresponding timestep
intervals associated with each mixed model. The value in each grid refers to the coefficients that will
be used to weight the corresponding basis models. At early timesteps T →999, Remix-DiT tend
to use an ensembled model for inference, which is averaged over all basis models. And at the late
timesteps T →0, more specialized models, such as the first basis model are picked for fine-grained
prediction.

designed partitions. The raw mixer, with its learnable coefficients, achieved better performance but
included some impractical solutions, such as negative coefficients, which increased learning difficulty.
The softmax mixer yielded the best results.

Global or Local Mixer.
A DiT model typically comprises multiple layers. When mixing models,
we can use globally shared mixing coefficients, referred to as the global mixer, or employ a layer-wise
independent mixing strategy, referred to as the local mixer. The first strategy is simpler to train, as
it requires only a small K × N coefficient matrix regardless of the network’s depth. The second
strategy, however, offers a larger model space by introducing trainable parameters that grow linearly
with the number of layers. Despite this, the additional parameter size for both methods is very small
compared to the original DiT model, which usually has tens to hundreds of millions of parameters.
We validated both strategies in Table 2. However, we found that a simple global mixer yielded
slightly better performance compared to the local mixer. For simplicity, we use a global mixer in our
experiments.

The Number of Experts and Basis
In this part, we also explored the impact of different numbers
of basis and expert models on the algorithm’s performance. It is evident that indefinitely increasing
the number of expert models does not continuously enhance performance. There are three reasons for
this: 1) First, the total capacity of the basis models is limited. With 4 basis models, it is difficult to
craft 1,000 varied experts for denoising; 2) As illustrated in Figure 4a, some denoising steps share
similar mixing coefficients, which limits the maximal number of effective experts in our method; 3)
Due to the fact that only one expert is activated in forward and backward passes, the gradient w.r.t the
mixing coefficients will be sparse. With a large coefficient table, the sparsity level of gradients will
be higher, which introduces difficulty in optimization. However, compared to training the same K
expert models independently, our algorithm’s advantage lies in its ability to learnably allocate the
model’s capacity through mixing coefficients. This allocation is done through a soft partition based on

weighted loss, rather than a hard partition on individual models. This allows us to roughly choose an
appropriate N which is slightly larger than the optimal N ∗, and the learnable coefficients can “merge”
some experts if necessary by generating the same coefficients. For example, as shown in Figure
4a, we can find highly similar coefficients between the timestep intervals [900, 950] and [950, 1000],
which means we don’t need to allocate different experts in these timesteps. In our experiments, we
craft 20 experts with 4 basis models.

Inference and training Efficiency.
In Table 3, we present the training and inference efficiency
of the proposed Remix-DiT. We found that the training speed slightly decreased from 2.93 to 2.29
due to the mixing of four basis models. Additionally, our method requires extra GPU memory to
store the basis models. During inference, we estimated the latency of compact models that craft
experts at runtime and a standard multi-expert denoising approach, where all experts are precomputed.
Post-training, our method can achieve efficiency comparable to a standard DiT.

Visualization of Generated Images.
Table 5 compares the generated images of the proposed
RemixDiT-B and DiT-B. It can be observed that the shape of objects can be improved using the
proposed methods. This is as expected since we allocate more model capacity to the early and
intermediate stages of denoising, as illustrated in Figure 4, which mainly contributes to the image
contents rather than details.

Limitations and Broader Impact

In this work, we introduce a learnable coefficient, implemented as a simple embedding layer for
mixing. However, due to the limitations of the deep learning framework, we can only create one
expert per forward and backward pass. This leads to sparse gradients in the embedding layers, where
coefficients without gradients can only be updated with momentum rather than accurate gradients.
One solution to alleviate this issue is distributed training, where processes craft different expert

models. Despite this, the challenge remains significant when training a Remix-DiT with a large
number of experts, such as 1000. However, according to the visualization of learned coefficients, we
find that 1000 experts may not be necessary since many adjacent timesteps share a similar model. In
addition, this work will not introduce negative societal impact.

Conclusion

In this work, we introduce a multi-expert method to enhance the quality of transformer-based diffusion
models while maintaining an acceptable inference overhead. The core contribution lies in the ability
to craft a large number of experts from a few basis models, thereby significantly reducing the training
effort. Besides, with our method, we don’t have to accurately estimate the optimal number of required
experts, since the learnable coefficients will adaptive merge experts if necessary, which brings huge
flexibility to the practice.

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This submission introduced a new method for multi-expert denoising.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: A limitation section is included.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This work does not involve theoretical results.
Guidelines:

14


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide hyper-parameters in the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Code is available in the supplemental material.

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Training details is summarized in the paper and appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: This submission does not include error bars.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The number of GPUs, training efficiency and memory are reported in the
paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research was conducted with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the societal impacts in the main paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All papers and assets properly credited.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not release new assets.

18


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
