Abstract

Most large multimodal models (LMMs) are implemented by feeding visual tokens
as a sequence into the first layer of a large language model (LLM). The resulting
architecture is simple but significantly increases computation and memory costs,
as it has to handle a large number of additional tokens in its input layer. This paper
presents a new architecture DeepStack for LMMs. Considering N layers in the
language and vision transformer of LMMs, we stack the visual tokens into N groups
and feed each group to its aligned transformer layer from bottom to top, as illustrated
in Fig. 1. Surprisingly, this simple method greatly enhances the power of LMMs to
model interactions among visual tokens across layers but with minimal additional
cost. We apply DeepStack to both language and vision transformer in LMMs, and
validate the effectiveness of DeepStack LMMs with extensive empirical results.
Using the same context length, our DeepStack 7B and 13B parameters surpass their
counterparts by 2.7 and 2.9 on average across 9 benchmarks, respectively. Using
only one-fifth of the context length, DeepStack rivals closely to the counterparts

that use the full context length. These gains are particularly pronounced on high-
resolution tasks, e.g., 4.2, 11.0, and 4.0 improvements on TextVQA, DocVQA, and
InfoVQA compared to LLaVA-1.5-7B, respectively. We further apply DeepStack to
vision transformer layers, which brings us a similar amount of improvements, 3.8
on average compared with LLaVA-1.5-7B.

Introduction

With the tremendous advancements in large language models (LLMs) [62, 63, 87, 6, 6, 65, 59], we
have witnessed a surge of efforts of developing large multimodal models (LMMs) [51, 88]. To
connect vision and language models for LMMs, a conventional way is transforming images into a
number of visual features using pretrained vision encoders (e.g., CLIP [61]), and flattening them to
a sequence of “language tokens” which are then fed into an LLM. With sufficient alignment and
instruction tuning, the entire system can demonstrate a broad conversational capability for multimodal
inputs [51].

To incorporate visual inputs, it usually requires the LMMs to handle a large number of visual tokens
as the prefix tokens in addition to the original language prompts. This inevitably introduces a
tremendous memory and compute overhead into the LLMs, which is particularly significant when
it comes to high-resolution images and multi-frame videos. Several previous works attempt to
mitigate this issue by proposing various token compression strategies. A straightforward way is
to reduce the number of tokens with spatial grouping [70, 47]. Instead of pooling vision tokens,
a few work instead to concatenate local tokens along the feature dimension to preserve visual
information [11, 48]. Moreover, other works seek more sophisticated token resampling, such as
Q-Former [43], Perceiver [4] and Abstractor [8], etc. In MM1 [57], the researchers performed an
extensive analysis of these approaches and found no significant discrepancies among them. Despite
the huge effort, all these works inherently sacrifice fine-grained visual information to reach the
trade-off between the compute overhead and the information flow into LLMs, which is arguably
problematic for high-resolution images and videos. Most recently, a few works [22, 48, 50, 19, 20]
proposed multi-crop strategies and string several times more visual tokens to support high-resolution
scenarios, while at the cost of substantial overhead.

All current efforts to wire vision with LLMs follow the routine in which visual tokens are always
rolled together as a 1d sequence, and fed into the first layer of LLMs as inputs. In this work, we step
outside the box and question whether we can find a better strategy to handle the large number of
visual tokens regarding both efficacy and efficiency. Instead of examining the LLMs in a traditional
left-to-right orientation, we adopt a novel bottom-to-top perspective, revealing that they constitute a
hierarchical arrangement of transformer layers. Based on this observation, we propose DeepStack, a
simple, yet novel way of feeding visual tokens into LLMs. As shown in Fig. 1, instead of putting the
long sequence of visual tokens from left to right, we restructure the visual tokens into a layered stack,
where each layer of the stack is connected to one layer in the LLMs by simple residual connection. As
a result, with the context length unchanged, we can feed into LLMs several times more visual tokens
to handle complex visual inputs. Meanwhile, the combination of per-layer parallel attention and
layer-by-layer progression can effectively leverage the LLMs’ capacity for modeling the dependencies
of visual tokens.

To examine the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to two representative LMMs, LLaVA-1.5 [51]
and LLaVA-Next [50]. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. More
specifically, with the same setting of LLaVA-1.5, our model can achieve significant performance gain
across a wide range of benchmarks. In particular, our model brings 4.2, 11.0, and 4.0 performance
gains on TextVQA, DocVQA, and InfoVQA compared to LLaVA-1.5-7B, respectively. To summarize,
our main contributions are three-fold:

• We propose a simple yet effective DeepStack strategy for connecting vision and language in
the context of LMMs. This new strategy introduces no architecture change while significantly
increasing the number of tokens LLMs can take.

• With the DeepStack strategy, we present our new model DeepStack, and compare it with LMMs
across a wide range of multimodal tasks. Our model demonstrates consistent improvement over the
baseline methods, in particular for high-resolution tasks.

• We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies on different aspects of our proposed method,
which provide useful guidance and insights behind the design choices.

Finally, although we only demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in the context of
LMMs, we note that this simple strategy could be generalized to any models or tasks built on top of
transformer layers. We hope this new design could shield new lights and open up new exploratory
directions regarding how to wire vision encoders and LLMs in large multimodal models.

Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed
significant progress, particularly with the advent of large language models (LLMs) [74, 87, 64,
6]. Building on the foundational architecture of Transformers [75], language models [18, 74, 87,
64, 6, 39] have demonstrated strong scalability through the pretraining-then-finetuning paradigm.
Specifically, BERT [18] utilizes the transformer encoder and introduces a masked language modeling
task to pre-train the model on vast unlabelled data, showing excellent performance after fine-tuning
on downstream tasks. Other follow-ups [39, 36] continue along the lines of BERT, constantly refining
and optimizing its performance. The T5 [64] series further unifies different NLP tasks within an
encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating effectiveness across dozens of language understanding
tasks. Meanwhile, the GPT [62, 63, 4] series employs simple decoder-only transformers to pretrain
the language model using a unified next-token prediction paradigm. This approach shows remarkable
scalability in terms of both model size and data scale. To enhance instruction-following abilities,
InstructGPT [59] and ChatGPT emphasize the importance of instruction tuning and Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). These models exhibit excellent capabilities in open-
domain conversation tasks, ranging from text generation to question answering. In response to
ChatGPT, recent works [74, 15, 38] have made significant efforts in developing an open-source
LLMs community. Building on the success of the LLaMA [74] series foundation model, Alpaca [71],
Vicuna [15], and GPT-4-LLM [60] showcase the improvements brought by higher-quality instruction
datasets. Other works [24, 27, 1, 86] take a different approach, aiming to achieve comparable
performance with a much smaller set of parameters. The Phi [24, 27, 1] series revisits the importance
of the pre-training corpus and achieves success with models containing around 3 billion parameters. In
this paper, we develop our model based on Vicuna [15] and Phi-3 [1], aiming to equip the well-trained
LLMs with informative visual tokens and a relatively small training effect.

Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs). The success of CLIP [61] and its follow-ups [66, 28, 77]
demonstrates the effectiveness of aligning vision and language modalities into a unified semantic
space, showcasing promising capabilities in zero-shot classification tasks. More recently, Flamingo [3]
and BLIP [44] have utilized visual perceivers [26] to resample visual tokens from image features
as inputs for language models through cross-attention. BLIP-2 [42] and Instruct-BLIP [16] further
incorporate this mechanism into large language models for tasks such as visual captioning and
question-answering. Although visual perceivers can translate image features into a fixed set of
visual tokens, they face constraints related to convergence costs and data requirements. In parallel,
LLaVA and its follow-ups [13, 76, 47, 50, 49] achieved success in connecting vision and language
using a simple projection module. It greatly simplifies the difficulties of alignment tasks and even
achieves better performance with less training effort. However, due to the rigorous input resolution of
pre-trained models, these directions meet difficulties on downstream tasks requiring finer-grained
visual information, e.g. tasks relevant to OCR and documents. To alleviate this problem, recent
works [48, 22, 21, 73, 89] utilize a mixture of experts (MOE) schemes to leverage different pre-
trained vision models, typically assembling the visual tokens along the feature dimension. Other
attempts [85, 19, 50] split high-resolution images into multi-crop patches and merge them into a
longer sequence, which significantly increases the training and evaluation cost. In this work, we
conduct experiments on the projector-based connection framework and revisit the connection scheme
that utilizes projected visual tokens for the input layer of LLMs. We find that the early layers of
LLMs can also well process visual token inputs. Besides that, we propose a DeepStack scheme to
stack finer-grained visual tokens to the early layers of LLMs, enhancing visual capabilities without
introducing extra input tokens.

Figure 2: Architecture of DeepStack. The main innovation lies in the DeepStack strategy that infuses visual
tokens into different layers. Left: DeepStack for LLMs. Given an input image, we feed the tokens extracted
from the low-resolution version to the input layer of LLM. Considering the 2D nature of images, we extra
the neighbors from the high-resolution version and reorganize them into DeepStack, which are then fed to the
consequent layers in LLMs. Right: DeepStack for ViTs. We apply similar sampling strategy but feed the visual
tokens into the ViT layers of vision encoder.

DeepStack

DeepStack is a versatile strategy that provides finer-grained visual information without increasing the
visual context length for LMMs. It achieves this by dividing image feature extraction into two streams:
a global-view stream that captures global information, and a high-resolution stream that enhances the
global information by stacking dilated high-resolution image features across different layers of the
LLMs. This dual-stream approach offers LMMs detailed visual features while maintaining efficiency.
By leveraging this simple yet effective method, we build DeepStack, which significantly improves
the ability of LMMs to process and comprehend fine-grained visual details. We illustrate DeepStack
in Fig. 2 and propose a pseudo-code implementation in Algorithm. 1.

3.1
Preliminary: Large Multimodal Model

Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs [2, 11, 70, 74] are typically pre-trained on a huge amount
of unlabeled text corpus using a transformer decoder-only architecture. The primary pre-training
task is next-token prediction driving their learning process. Formally, the learning objective can be
formulated as:

L =

N
X

t=1
log Pθ(xt+1 | x1:t)
(1)

where P represents the large language model and θ is the trainable parameters of the model, with the
training objective to maximize the probability of xt+1 as the next token, given the previous tokens
x1:t = x1, . . . , xt.

Language Multi-modal Models (LMMs). LMMs extend pre-trained LLMs to generate responses
conditioned on input images. This is achieved by using visual tokens as a prefix:

L =

N
X

t=1
log Pθ(xt+1 | x1:t, X)
(2)

where X ∈Rl×c represents the sequence of visual tokens [43, 51, 4], with l being the squence length
and c the hidden dimension of the LLM.

Image Tokenization. Previous works [45, 43, 51] widely explored how to encode input images
into visual tokens. The tokenization schemes usually leverage a vision-language pre-trained image
encoder Fv, e.g. CLIP [61], to extract image features f v from an input image I. Then, the image
features are converted into visual tokens using a connection module M as follows:

X = M(f v); f v = Fv(I)

The connection module M can take various forms, mainly divided into projection modules [51, 49]
and perceiver resamplers [4, 43]. In the former, M is implemented as either a single-layer linear
projection [51] or a multi-layer MLP [49], directly projecting dense image features into the hidden
space of the LLM. In the latter, M utilizes a cross-attention mechanism with a set of fixed-length
learnable queries to extract image features, similar to the approach in [7]. They transform dense
image features into sparse image queries, which are then used as input tokens for the language model.
However, the resamplers-based methods easily struggle with hallucinations on spatial reasoning
tasks [17]. In this paper, we mainly focus on the projection-based connection module for its efficiency
and effectiveness.

3.2
DeepStack for Improved Image Tokenization

Now that we obtain the visual tokens for LMMs using a projection-based connection module, the
following challenge is how to provide informative visual tokens while keeping the multi-modal
processing effective.

Scaling Visual Tokens. Based on the projection-based connection module, many follow-up attempts
to increase the visual capability by introducing multiple image crops [50, 73] for scaling up the
resolution or involving multiple vision encoders to serve as a mixture of visual experts [89, 73, 21].
For these approaches, the visual tokens from different image crops or vision encoders are concatenated
together along the axis of the sequence or the dimension before projection.

DeepStack Strategy. In order to incorporate fine-grained image information while maintaining
efficiency, we enhance the input visual tokens X by stacking high-resolution visual tokens into
different LLM decoder layers. In practice, we first upsample the input image according to its aspect
ratio and simultaneously tokenize it to obtain high-resolution visual tokens. To prepare the tokens
for hierarchy stacking, we split the high-resolution visual tokens into different token sets Xstacki

with spatial dilation [80, 14]. This sampling approach ensures that the visual tokens Xstacki have the
same length as the global visual tokens X. Additionally, token Xstacki corresponds to the nearest
neighbor of X in spatial.

Xstack = {Xstack1, Xstack2, ..., Xstacks}

As shown in Fig. 2, given an LLM of L decoder layers, the LLM is first split into different blocks.
Specifically, DeepStack split the early layers of LLM P into a set of deepstack blocks BV =
{PV 1, PV 2, ..., PV n} for stacking visual tokens, and the later layers into a plain block PL for
original prefix sequential modeling. We denote that each deepstack block PV i ends at the N V i-th
layer of P, while the plain block PL ends at the last layer. We use Hi to represent the hidden states
of visual tokens after the i-th transformer decoder layer, with HL being the visual hidden states after
the final decoder layer. Formally, the output of each block can be formulated as follows:

HV 1 = PV 1 

HV 2 = PV 2 
HV 1
+ Xstack2

HL = PL 

---Page Break---
Specifically, we divide the layers into equally sized deepstack blocks, with the block length of 1 by
default.

DeepStack for Vision Transformers (ViTs). Our DeepStack can be also applied to ViTs for better
feature extraction and image tokenization as illustrated in Fig. 2 (DeepStack-V). In contrast to LMM,
we use the patch embedding layers PatchEmbedding and the first several ViT encoder layers for
tokenization and the reset ViT encoder layers for DeepStack. Formally, we replace the F and M
in Eq. (4) with the Patch Embedding Layers and the first several encoder layers, and utilize the rest of
encoders layers as P in Eq. (5). Please refer to Sec. 4.3 for more details.

Comparison with Other Visual Token Enhancement Strategies. To provide a deeper understanding
of the DeepStack mechanism, we compare our strategy with previous visual token enhancement
strategies by examining the hidden states of visual tokens after the final LLM decoder layer, denoted
as HL. Previous methods can be broadly categorized into two approaches: Sequence Concatenation
and Dimension Concatenation.

As for the former, visual tokens from the entire image and local crops are concatenated sequentially,
significantly increasing the overall sequence length the computation cost. The LLM decoder processes
these concatenated visual tokens as a longer visual prefix, directly modeling the extended sequence.

HL = P
 
SeqCat[X, Xstack]

(6)

As for the latter, visual tokens are concatenated along the feature dimension, keeping the sequence
length constant. When using a projection module as the connection module, the enhanced visual
tokens can be viewed as the sum of features from two individual projection modules.

HL = P

In our DeepStack, we employ a unique approach where enhancement occurs from bottom to top
layer by layer. The processing of HL in DeepStack unfolds in two phases. In the early layers of the
decoder, the layers function similarly to an encoder, recurrently enhancing the input visual tokens
by adding high-resolution visual tokens residually; In the later layers, the decoder performs plain
sequence modeling as usual. This dual-phase processing fully leverages the LLM’s capabilities by
combining both encoding and sequence modeling. By integrating high-resolution visual information
at multiple layers, DeepStack effectively enhances visual token representation without increasing
visual context length, demonstrating its superiority over previous methods.

Implementation Details

We mainly follow the training recipe of Llava [51], of which the training pipeline consists of two
stages, i.e. pre-training (PT) stage and supervised-finetuning (SFT) stage. We utilize pre-trained
CLIP-large-336 [61] as our default image encoder. To obtain high-resolution feature maps, we split
the high-resolution image into patches to comply with the resolution requirement and mosaic the
image feature together as whole-image features.

Pre-training dataset. We utilize LCS-558k [51] as pre-training data for both experiments based on
LLaVA-1.5 and LLaVA-Next, which contain 558k samples from LAION [66], CC [9] and SBU [84],
captioned by BLIP [45].

Fine-tuning datasets. We utilize LLaVA-mixed-665k [51] as instruction-following data for both
experiments based on LLaVA-1.5. However, the SFT dataset used in Llava-Next is not publicly

available, we thus combine an SFT dataset of 748K samples following the guidance [50]. In contrast,
we do not involve the user images uploaded to their website.

Training configuration. We train our model with only the projection model tuned in the PT stage.
In SFT stage, we unfreeze LLM. For Experiments on DeepStack-V and DeepStack-HD, we tune
the image encoder with a learning rate of 1e-6 following [50]. Otherwise, we freeze our vision
encoder for a fair comparison. We use 16× V100 for experiments with Phi-3 [1] and 8× H100 for
experiments with Vicuna [15]. Please refer to our supplementary material for more detailed training
hyper-parameters.

Quantitive Results

We evaluate DeepStack on a range of benchmarks, encompassing both academic task-oriented evalua-
tions and recent large multi-modal language model (LMM) benchmarks. Specifically, we focus on
text-oriented datasets, including ChartVQA [54], DocVQA [56], InfoVQA [55], MultiDocVQA [72],
TextVQA [69], to demonstrate effectiveness in high-resolution scenarios. Additionally, we perform
zero-shot evaluations of DeepStack on commonly used video understanding benchmarks to assess its
performance on finer-grained tasks.

General VQA and LMM benchmarks. We assess DeepStack on two classic general VQA bench-
marks, VQAv2 [23] and GQA [25], as well as five recent LMM benchmarks: SEED [40], POPE [46],
MMMU [83], and MM-Vet [81]. As presented in Tab. 1, DeepStack outperforms its direct baseline
model, LLaVA, on both VQAv2 and GQA, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in traditional
VQA tasks. Furthermore, DeepStack consistently surpasses other methods on the recent LMM
benchmarks. DeepStack achieves comparable performance on MM-Vet on the experiments based on
LLaVA-1.5. However, due to we lack of fancy instruction-following data used in LLaVA-mix-765K,
our experiments with LLaVA-Next lag behind the LLaVA-Next. Notably, the significant performance
boost on the POPE benchmark suggests that our DeepStack strategy effectively alleviates visual
hallucination by providing rich and detailed visual information for visual understanding.

Text-Oriented benchmarks. To further validate the effectiveness of DeepStack, we evaluate it
on more text-oriented benchmarks, including ChartQA [54], DocVQA [56], InfoVQA [55], Multi-
DocVQA [72], and TextVQA [69]. These benchmarks contain high-resolution images and typically
require the model to answer questions based on fine-grained visual inputs. As shown in Tab. 2,

equipping our model with DeepStack results in consistent gains across all benchmarks. This strongly
demonstrates that DeepStack enhances visual token even without increasing sequence length.

Zero-shot performance on Video QA benchmarks. We also conduct zero-shot evaluations on
video QA benchmarks, including EgoSchema [52] and Next-QA [78] for multiple-choice VQA, and
MSVD-QA [10, 79] and ActivityNet-QA [82] for open-ended VQA. Inspired by [33], we sample
frames from each video uniformly and mosaic the frames into images to adapt video QA tasks to the
image domain. Thanks to the higher effective resolution brought by refined visual tokens, DeepStack
effectively handles zero-shot video QA tasks even without being fine-tuned on any video data.

Model Inspection

We further conduct sufficient experiments to give in-depth inspiration on the mechanism of DeepStack.
In this section, we experiment with phi-3 [1] as the language backbone for the training efficiency.
We report the performance on 7 benchmarks, including 1 general VQA (GQA), 2 multi-modal
benchmarks (POPE and SEED), and 4 text-oriented VQA (TextVQA, DocVQA, ChartQA and
InforVQA). We can evaluate the model performance by comparing the average scores over the 7
benchmarks.

different starting layers and initialize the correspondence input embeddings as zero; (b) We fix the first layer to

number of layers for token stacking.
LLMs can well process visual tokens in the early decoder layers. To understand why earlier
layers of LLMs are suitable for processing visual tokens, we conducted an experiment on the
insertion layer for visual tokens. Traditionally, visual tokens are inserted at the input layer, e.g.
0-th layer. We progressively insert them deeper, initializing the corresponding input embeddings to

zero. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), inserting visual tokens before the 8th of 32 decoder layers in Phi-3
results in acceptable performance variations. However, inserting them beyond the midpoint leads
to a significant performance drop. This confirms that earlier layers efficiently handle initial visual
information integration. We also explore the impact of inserting visual tokens at non-consecutive
layers. In Fig. 3 (b), we fixed global visual tokens at the input layer and varied the interval between
two decoder layers for stacking high-resolution tokens. All stacking settings consistently improved
performance. Finally, we explored the number of layers used for stacking high-resolution tokens. As
shown in Fig. 3 (c), increasing the layers for stacking consistently enhances overall performance,
with the best results achieved using four layers.

Baseline

DeepStack can also boost Vision Transformers (ViT). To further
explore the potential of DeepStack for vision transformers, we utilize
the DeepStack on ViT. Specifically, we use the patch embedding
layers and the first N ViT encoder layers to extract visual tokens,
including the original tokens and 4× extra high-resolution tokens,
and then stack the high-resolution tokens into the next 4 encoder
layers, respectively. We need to unfreeze the vision encoder to
adapt the pre-trained encoder to our DeepStack. As shown in Tab. 4
and Sec. 4.3, when using the first 16 ViT encoder layers (total 24 layers for our ViT-Large) to extract
visual tokens before DeepStack, DeepStack-V surpass the baseline model. And the performance
keeps increasing when using more encoder layers before DeepStack.

Better spatial consistency leads to better performance.
Different sampling strategies may lead to different results.
In Tab. 5, we compare our default strategy with two other
variants for organizing the visual tokens. As shown in Fig. 4,
2d Grid use each of the local crop as a layer and 1d Sequence
simply flatten the visual tokens to one-dimensional and then re-
shape them into a layer stack. Accordingly, keeping the spatial
coherence, i.e. 2d Spatial, as in our default setting could achieve the best result.

Table 5: Ablations on image consistency and sampling method. We apply the Resize transformation to
both the original image and the high-resolution image for consistency. For inconsistency, we use Resize on the
original image and Pad-Resize on the high-resolution image. 2d Spatial refers to sampling based on spatial
locations, such as using a 4-neighbor method. 2d Grid means the visual tokens are divided into 2d grids, with
each grid stacked per layer. 1d Sequential indicates that the high-resolution visual tokens are first flattened into a
sequence and then uniformly sampled for each layer. Please refer to Fig. 4 for better understanding.

DeepStack boosts LMMs from high-resolution tokens, not residual connections. We experiment
to assess the impact of high-resolution images and residual connections in DeepStack by stacking
original visual tokens into different layers. As shown in Tab. 6, stacking repeated original tokens
(dummy tokens) does not improve performance. This indicates that the performance boost in
DeepStack comes from the high-resolution tokens, not from the residual connections.

DeepStack achieves a better trade-off between performance and effectiveness. We compare Deep-
Stack with other token enhancement strategies, including dimension-wise concatenation, sequence-
wise with high-resolution visual tokens, and string both global visual and high-resolution tokens.
As shown in Tab. 7, although string-based methods can bring significant improvement on some
benchmarks, they increase the number of tokens at the same time, which will increase the training
and inference cost. Meanwhile, DeepStack achieves the best trade-off between performance and
effectiveness without introducing extra visual tokens.

DeepStack unleashes the power after fine-tuning the image encoder. We further experiment with
how DeepStack compared coporated with fine-tuning backbones. As shown in Tab. 4, DeepStack
achieves the best performance when fine-tuning the backbone. It is worth noticing that when fine-
tuning the backbone without DeepStack, the improvement is limited. After combining backbone
fietuning with DeepStack, the performance significantly increases among different benchmarks. It is
because of the deep interaction between visual tokens and the LLM decoder.

Conclusion

In this work, we had presented DeepStack, a simple yet effective way to connect vision and language
in the context of LMMs. Unlike previous works that always string (compressed) visual tokens into
a sequence, we alternatively introduced a new perspective on transformer decoder layers in LLMs,
and proposed a DeepStack strategy to feed different visual tokens into different layers of LLMs.
This strategy significantly mitigates the efficiency overhead introduced by visual tokens and makes
it possible to convey more visual information to LLMs. As a result, our DeepStack demonstrated
consistent improvements over two baseline models across a wide range of benchmarks. The benefits
are particularly significant on tasks that inherently require more tokens, such as high-resolution image
understanding. We hope this new DeepStack strategy could open up new ideas on how to connect
vision and language for faster and better multimodal models in the regime of LMMs.

Limitation and Future Works. DeepStack simply inserts the visual tokens into middle LLMs layers
via a residual connection in a heuristic manner. Though it already exhibits promising results, we may
find a more powerful way to infuse the visual information, e.g., through gated function or layer-wise
positional embeddings. Meanwhile, how to systematically decide the starting layer and number of
layers also deserves more study. We leave these as promising directions.

Q: Please describe in as much detail as possible what each person in the picture is doing.

In the image, there is a group of people gathered around a brown and white cow. A woman is 
standing next to the cow, holding its halter, while a man is standing nearby, possibly 
observing the scene. Other people are also present in the area, some standing closer to the 
cow and others further away. There are a few chairs scattered around the scene, with one 
near the center and two others closer to the right side. A truck can be seen in the background, 
possibly indicating that the event is taking place at a fair or similar outdoor venue.

In the image, there is a group of people gathered around a cow in a grassy field. A woman is 
standing next to the cow, possibly petting it or tending to it. Another woman is standing 
nearby, possibly observing the scene or waiting for her turn to interact with the cow.There are 
several other people in the background, some of whom are standing closer to the cow, while 
others are further away. A few individuals are wearing ties, which suggests a more formal or 
professional setting. In the scene, there are also a couple of chairs and a dining table, 
indicating that this gathering might be a social event or a meeting. A handbag can be seen 
placed on the ground, possibly belonging to one of the attendees.

The image features a circular diagram with various labels and numbers. The diagram is 
divided into different sections, each with its own set of labels and numbers. The central 
section of the diagram is labeled “VQA2,” while the surrounding sections are labeled “Pope,” 
“GQA,” “Seed,” “InfoVQA,” “DocVQA,” and “Sequence.” There are several numbers in the 
diagram, with some located in the central section and others scattered throughout the 
different sections. The numbers are likely used to represent data or information related to the 
various labels and sections of the diagram.

The image displays a graph with a central circle that represents a VOQA (Voice over QAM) 
system. The circle is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different aspect of the 
system. The quadrants are labeled with the acronyms VOQA, POP, GAOA, and TEX. The 
graph also includes several smaller circles scattered around the main circle, which are likely 
related to the VOQA system as well. These smaller circles are positioned at various distances 
from the main circle, indicating the different levels of the system.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research,
addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove
the checklist: The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected. The checklist should
follow the references and follow the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT count
towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For
each question in the checklist:

• You should answer [Yes] , [No] , or [NA] .
• [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the
relevant information is Not Available.
• Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission. They are visible to the
reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it
(after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published
with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation.
While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a
proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally
expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering
"[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we
acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and
write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the
supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification
please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

• Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading “NeurIPS paper checklist",
• Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.
• Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers.

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We properly claim our contribution in abstract and introduction.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper has discussed the limitations.

18


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper is not include theoretical result.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided all the details in the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

19


---Page Break---
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We release it to the public.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).

20


---Page Break---
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The training and test details have been reported in this paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: The cost of training required to report error bars is excessively high.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provided the computation resources in this paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

21


---Page Break---
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper conform the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided the broader impacts in our paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper did not release data or models for the main contribution.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.

22


---Page Break---
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: This paper follows the CC-BY 4.0 license in experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper did not introduce new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: No crowdsourcing and research with human subjects in our paper.

23


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No crowdsourcing experiments in this paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
